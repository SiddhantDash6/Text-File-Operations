 After our journey to the Red Capital ends, we'll be going back to our hometown ― Moosgrun.
 But, once I realized that we're finally going to head back... I couldn't help but feel a sudden sense of reluctance at ending our journey.
 I remembered all the things that had happened since the day we departed.
 Like buying tickets in the White Capital, being seen naked by Cero... somehow all the things I remembered were times when I'd messed up, it was a little sad to think about―
 
 Among those moments I recalled, there was one that I was still concerned about.

 And that was the time when Cero and I had gone to the Dornstein Castle at night.
 sv019d
 After climbing up to the castle wall, I thought Cero had gotten fed up with me and left, but in fact he was still waiting quietly for me below.
 
 black450
 In the end,
 
  I'd kissed his cheek out of impulse, and I still remembered that at that moment, he had said ‘Thank you.’
 
 I still wanted to know what he had meant by those words.
 black450
 bg18b01
 But, I hadn't had any chance to ask him since then.
 Furthermore, it's been long enough that he might have even forgotten about it.
 st03_c03
 v03wa1324
 ワカバ「...The opportunity doesn't come easily, I guess.」
 If ever there's a chance to ask him, it would be now, while we're still on the trip.
 ...With that thought, I wrote ‘Wait for me in the lobby’ on a piece of notepaper, and slipped it into my pocket.
 
 st03_c00
 Since it's Cero, when he sees this note, he'll definitely wait obediently for me until I appear in front of him.
 
 Since we planned to gather in front of the station, I'll go to the lobby when everyone else has left the hotel... then I'll ask Cero the meaning of that ‘Thank you’ as we walk together to the station.
 
 
 st03_c04
 And then, no matter what kind of answer I get, I can just change the subject by saying ‘Everyone is waiting for us!’ and running off ahead.
 
 v03wa1325
 ワカバ「(―What a nice idea!)」
 To execute this plan, I'd arrived in front of the door to his room, now I just need to slip this piece of paper under the door―
 
 But, somehow I couldn't find the courage to do it.
 st03_c07
 v03wa1326
 ワカバ「...Ah, forget it!」
 What would happen if he didn't notice the note... wouldn't I become really pathetic for doing this?
 st03_c02
 v03wa1327
 ワカバ「This belonged in the trash in the first place!」
 I threw that pathetic piece of paper into the trash bin in the lobby, and went ahead before anyone else to the train station by myself.

 Everyone else was already here, but for some reason, he wasn't.

 ワカバ「Hey, Coco, what happened to Cero?」

 Coco mimed a movement as if she were picking something up, and stretched out her to me. 
 I didn't need to ask her anything more.

 Let's hurry!」
 I looked at the time- there was still a couple of minutes left before departure!
 At least I wasn't carrying much, since I had given the luggage to Light earlier. I grabbed Cero's wrist, and headed for the station.
 
 But...

 Just like that time in the White Capital when I'd caused everyone trouble because I'd forgotten about the draft...
 st04_a00

 セロ「Oh well, we can catch up with them on the next train.」
 Everyone must have thought the same thing, that's why they went ahead...
  Cero said that as he patted his pants pocket.

 But, suddenly, his expression turned nervous.

 ワカバ「...What's wrong?」
 v04ce1341
 セロ「Hey, Wakaba, do you have any money on you?」
 v03wa1337

 But, if Cero's asking me that...
 He said ‘money’, this means―

 ワカバ「Could it be, Cero... you don't have our traveling money?」

 Only after trying it ourselves were we able to understand―

 Srhn_BGM06
 v04ce1344
 セロ「...Hitchhiking is pretty difficult.」
 st03_a03
 v03wa1341
 ワカバ「...You got that right.」
 We'd thought of asking Rein to help, but we'd been asking for his assistance since the start of the trip up to that matter in Aubergine. If we continue to ask him for more money... frankly, it's like robbery already. 
 
 
 Then let's just hitchhike! ...was what Wakaba had suggested. I agreed, thinking that this might be part of the fun of traveling, and then we ended up like this.
 
 Though there had been a generous old man who had let us ride with him, the car engine went dead in the middle of the trip.
 
 The old man told us that we could find another car if we left the highway. Trusting his advice, we started walking, and then found out that we had probably gone on the wrong road.
 
 After an hour, among these calm and peaceful scenery... all the cars that passed us by were two-seated convertibles that weren't calm or peaceful at all.
 
 We thought that we'd be able to find some place to stay after walking all these while, but―
 
 v04ce1345
 セロ「...There aren't even any villages around.」
 st03_a02
 v03wa1342
 ワカバ「Now that it's come to this, we'll bet on the next car!
 We're gonna flag it down no matter what!」
 But, after that, not even a single car had passed us.
 The reason for that is probably because we're walking on a country road that exits from the highway.

 ワカバ「...Yeah.」
 Back at the Dornstein Castle in the White Capital...
 v04ce1350
 セロ「I was really shocked back then.」
 When we went to visit it, we couldn't get into the castle, since it was closed for repairs―
 st03_a03
 v03wa1347
 ワカバ「...Do you mean when I kissed you?」
 v04ce1351
 セロ「Eh, n-no, that's not what I meant!
 I meant before that, when you said you wanted to climb the castle wall.」
 
 I'd panicked when she reminded me of that amazing event.
 st03_a07
 v03wa1348
 ワカバ「...Oh, so it's that...」
 I realized from Wakaba's sad expression that I shouldn't have denied that so strongly just now.
 
 v04ce1352
 セロ「...Well, I was shocked by the kiss too.」
 st03_a03
 I tried to prompt her, but it seemed that I was too late.
 I was left with no choice but to do as she did and stare wordlessly up at the sky.
 And then, suddenly, I remembered what Tonino had said to me in Azo.
 v07to0402
 トニー「But nevertheless. First, you have to tell the other person your feelings.」
 v07to0404
 トニー「I believe the other side... is waiting for someone to tell her his true feelings too.」
 At that time, I was separated from Wakaba.
 But now, she's right beside me―
 v04ce1353
 セロ「...Hey, Wakaba. What if I... well...」
 I gathered up my courage and asked her.
 v04ce1354
 セロ「What if I said I wanted you to kiss me one more time... would you get angry?」
 With Tonino's words in mind, I told her my honest feelings.
 st03_a00
 v03wa1349
 ワカバ「Of course I wouldn't get angry. But... why?」
 Her unexpected reply, and the question she threw back at me, made my heart beat faster.
 v04ce1355
 セロ「Wel, you see... At that time, I wasn't expecting it, but...」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1350
 ワカバ「...Dummy.」
 black450
 ...Eh?
 I felt the softness of her lips as they brushed against my cheek.
 bg05c03
 st03_a00
 v03wa1351
 ワカバ「Are you satisfied?
 Or do you want another one?」
 v04ce1356
 セロ「Um, rather than saying that I want another...」
 I lightly wrapped my arms around her neck, and kissed her back deeply.
 
 v04ce1357
 セロ「...Wakaba, I love you.」
  I confessed my feelings to her.
 If she doesn't feel the same, then it's all over.
 Still, I've been in love with her for such a long time―
 st03_a06
 v03wa1352
 ワカバ「...You should have told me sooner.」
 v04ce1358
 セロ「Sorry, I could never find a good time to say it.」
 Honestly, I hated myself for waiting until now to confess.
 
 I didn't like stirring things up, because I was afraid that they might not be able to return to the way they were before.
 
 Whenever I saw Light and Wakaba, I was always envious.
 No matter how much they quarreled, in the end they always came to a mutual understanding.
 I'd always been thinking about that... wishing that my relationship with Wakaba could be like that too... wishing, wishing... is all I could do.
 
 If she didn't accept my confession, things would never be the same between us... whenever I thought of that, I became hesitant.
 
 st03_a11
 v03wa1353
 ワカバ「Dummy!
 You could have said that anytime!
 I was really lonely after parting with you in the White Capital...」
 
 ...But, it was different now.
 After finally telling her my feelings, I had realized for the first time―
 ―that it was just as Wakaba had said.
 If I faced my own feelings, I could do this anytime.
 It's because of my fear that it would spoil our relationship that I had driven us further apart―
 And by doing that I had nearly lost what I held dear.
 ―As I held Wakaba in my arms, I finally understood that.

 The day of the real performance had finally arrived. Though there were still many problems remaining, there was no more time to worry about them.
 
 It was almost time for the play to start.
 Summoning my courage, I headed to the wing of the stage.

 A feeling surfaced inside me... it was not nervousness, but courage.
 I quietly held Belle's hands, and prayed that I could share this feeling with her too.

 アンジ「Everyone else should be in position by now.」

 v00an1474
 アンジ「(―I wonder if there's anything I can do for her...)」
 Just as I was thinking that, I heard footsteps approaching from behind me.
 v00an1475
 アンジ「(―There shouldn't be anyone else other than Belle and I in this wing.)」
 If Light came here because of some sort of misunderstanding, I need to ask him to return to his position immediately.
 
 But as I slowly turned around, the person standing there was someone I could never have expected.

 As I was searching for the words to express my gratitude, Mr. Helmer shook his head humbly, without a single word―

 And now his eyes had moved to Belle, who was beside me.

 They remained silent for quite a while, just like that.
 It was Belle who took a deep breath and broke the silence.

 アンジ「...My name is Christina Dorn.」
 Just like that, when I as the Princess introduced myself as the ruler of the White Kingdom, our play commenced.
 
 Here stands the Princess of the White Kingdom, Christina- whom the audience surely knows suffered a brutal death at the hands of the traitor Ein, in the play ‘The Angel's Guidance.’
 
 
 ...But, this play is different.
 In this play, a different future shall be shown!
 st01_b00
 The girl who arrived at the White Kingdom was an angel sent by the Red Kingdom.
 Due to miscommunication, she was stopped before the front of the castle gate.
 
 face05_b02
 v05li0744
 ライト「Yarrh, halt!」
 The soldier played by Light had not been informed of the coming of the angel, and he endeavored to guard the gate as best he could.
 Still, the soldier had no idea what to do when faced with such a beautiful angel, and thus went back into the castle.
 
 
 st05_b05
 And after a time, the soldier returned.
 
 
 v05li0745
 ライト「Pardon my rudeness, please, do pass!」
  after saying that, the soldier escorted her into the castle.
 st05_b00
 Since Light was nervous, it was unavoidable that his movements were stiff.
 Still, he dutifully escorted the angel to the scene in which she met Princess Christina.

 face01_b06
 v01be1203
 ベル「I am honored to stand before you, Princess Christina. I am an angel without a name. Please call me by any name that is to your liking.」
 
 Faced with the doll upon her knees, Princess Christina took hold of her hand, raised her to her feet, slowly drew her into her arms, and said...
 
 
 
 st00_g06
 st00_b06
 v00an1483
 アンジ「...Then I shall bestow upon you the name of one who serves the gods― Schwester.」
 Originally, the script had no name for her, and that was the reason I called her Schwester.
 
 But we changed our mind, and decided to let Princess Christina give the angel that name.
 
 Because of that, the relationship between the princess and the angel grew much closer instantly.
 Since the day they had met, they were bound by an invisible string of intimacy, though of course... nobody else around them was able to realize that.
 
 But, as time went on, someone who realized the bond between the two appeared.
 st04_b02
 He was the ambassador from the Red Kingdom.
 v04ce1421
 セロ「...Oh, Schwester, how is life in this kingdom?」
 
 
 Though he had called her by the name given her by Princess Christina, her face remained unmoved.
 
 face01_b06
 v01be1204
 ベル「Yes, thanks to Her Highness's tuning, I am quite happy here.」
 Upon hearing those words, the ambassador's expression became dubious.
 v04ce1422
 セロ「Do not forget your purpose. You are a doll important to our Red Kingdom,」
 and reminded the angel of her place.
 Since she was a precious doll sent here for the purpose of maintaining diplomatic relations, if by any chance she did not return from the White Kingdom, the person responsible... would be the ambassador himself.
 
 
 face01_b03
 v01be1205
 ベル「...I have not forgotten.」
 Of course, that was not entirely a statement merely to please the ambassador.
 st04_b03
 v04ce1423
 セロ「If anything were to happen to you, war between the kingdoms is a possibility.」
 The ambassador told her of how the peace between the three kingdoms was a precarious one, and a major crisis might occur if she acted foolishly.
 
 
 v00an1484
 アンジ「...Oh Schwester, where might you be?」
 face01_b05
 As the voice of the princess echoed,
 st04_b06
 v04ce1424
 セロ「Be sure to always keep that in mind, Schwester,」
 
 
 the Red Ambassador gave her this final warning, and walked away with broad steps.
 v00an1485
 アンジ「Answer me if you are here.」
 As the voice of Princess Christina drew closer, the ambassador of the Red Kingdom― Cero- vanished into the darkness of the stage's wing.
 
 v03wa1304
 ワカバ「(―Looking good, looking good...)」
 The role of the ambassador Cero was acting served to inform the audience of the political situation regarding the three kingdoms.
 
 The best way to convey the relationship between the three kingdoms to the audience in the shortest amount of time is through the actor's interactions. In that sense, letting Cero play this role was definitely the right choice.
 
 v03wa1305
 ワカバ「(―Great, just keep it up...)」
 Thanks to Cero and Light's earnest performances, the setting of the play has been established, and the scenes with Angelina and Belle continued smoothly.
 
 And now, it's finally the scene where Valery shall appear, played by Tonino!

 st07_f03
 The man in an ascot, bowing before Angelina and Belle, was Tonino as Valery Jacquard.
 
 v03wa1306
 ワカバ「(―Ugh, I guess this is unavoidable after all...)」
 The appearance of Valery, who looked like a comedic character, had generated some laughs from the audience seats.
 Still, his acting skills were marvelous in the play!
 Even though the overall feeling of the character would have be better if he had shaved his goatee, I hadn't wanted to force him to.
 
 black450
 Moreover, I was the one that had thought he looked amusing like that and told him to just go for it.

 As I watched their performance and prayed for this scene to end smoothly, a voice came from Aunt Nicola, who was sitting beside me.

 ―Could it be that Tonino had made a huge mistake somewhere?!

 Banishing my sudden fear, I saw Aunt Nicola's eyes were fixed on the stage, mesmerized.
 ...That which captivated her was not Angelina or anyone else, but none other than Tonino.
 
 v07to0211
 トニー「This won't do, this won't do!」
 Why was her attention drawn by Tonino and not Angelina?
 Just as I started wondering, the other girl from the orphanage who sat beside Aunt Nicola looked at her face questioningly.

 When I watched her murmur to herself in happiness, I realized something.
 v07to0212
 トニー「...Then, I shall take my leave.」
 sv022l
 As she listened to Tonino's line before his exit from the stage, she closed her eyes quietly.
 
 There was no doubt her expression showed her love for not just one of her children... but two.
 
 
 Then, she turned to me as she watched Princess Christina call for Tonino to stop out of the corner of her eye, and...
 
 v10ni0169
 ニコラ「...Thank you, Wakaba,」
  she suddenly said to me.
 v03wa1307
 ワカバ「...Ah, I didn't really do...」
 For a moment, I wasn't sure what she was thanking me for, but then I realized that it must be because I'd invited everyone from the orphanage to the theater festival.
 
 v03wa1308
 ワカバ「E-excuse me...」
 ―Could it be that Aunt Nicola knows something about Tonino?
 I considered asking her quietly as the stage faded to black.
 
 But, instead...

 As the Red Ambassador brushed past Princess Christina,
 st13_a02
 v14ba0041
 銀行員「Princess Christina!」
 he encountered a person who seemed to be chasing after the princess- it was the Minister of the White Kingdom.
 According to Coco, the Minister had vanished before the crisis had happened.
 
 I had speculated his disappearance must have had something to do with the conspiracy, but we had no choice but to be creative with the parts Coco did not know.

 銀行員「If you don't mind my company, shall I show you around the castle?」
 Though there was something disturbing hidden within the eyes of the Minister as he said that, the Red Ambassador had no reason to reject, thus they both started strolling around the castle.
 
 But, after they both chatted for a while―
 st13_a03
 v14ba0046
 銀行員「By the way, I have a suggestion, if you would hear me out...」
 ...that sinister look of his was testament to his evil plot.
 
 st13_a07
 He told the Red Ambassador how it would benefit the diplomatic relationship between the two kingdoms if Princess Christina were to be brought to the Red Kingdom.
 
 face04_b03
 But the Red Ambassador showed no interest in this scheme.
 The White Minister shook his head in regret, bid farewell to the Red Ambassador,
 
 
  and went to a corner of the courtyard while glancing warily about―
 st13_a02
 v14ba0047
 銀行員「Regretfully, the Red Ambassador will not be cooperating.」
 
 
 As he shielded the side of his mouth with his hand, he spoke to a black curtain, a supposedly empty space.
 In the script, the mysterious character behind the black curtain is said to not be identifiable by either shape or voice.
 st13_b00
 v14ba0048
 銀行員「...What should we do next?」
 Up until now, the Minister had been playing a one-man show- but suddenly, a shadow behind the curtains signaled to the old banker with its hands, as if that person was giving him secret instructions.
 
 v14ba0049
 銀行員「I understand. Then please leave it to me.」
 st13_b03
 After getting his answer, the Minister walked away, glowering with menace.
 
 st13_b04

 ファビ「I am the ambassador from the Blue Kingdom, Valery. I am most pleased to make your acquaintance.」
 But, I hadn't done any rehearsals at all with the other actor acting as Ein, which is my role's rival.
 
 
 
 To top it up, Wakaba even mentioned that it wouldn't be weird if that actor ran late on the real performance.

 Angelina was performing as a most magnificent Princess Christina.
 And by her side stood Belle, who was playing as the Schwester― Efa.

 Though she was a little stiff, Belle spoke with a loud, clear voice, and gazed at me earnestly.
 
 v09fa0029
 ファビ「...The rumors were quite right. That play demonstrated well the beauty of your voice... truly, as they say, the songs of an angel―」
 Though I― Valery- kept praising her, the Schwester remained silent and only nodded in response.
 v09fa0030
 ファビ「(―The both of them aren't bad at all...)」
 ...Alright, now comes the main problem.
 In the script, Valery's scheming caused Ein to be late for his audience.

 But in reality, the actor for Ein actually was running late, so we needed to ad-lib.
 
 v03wa0988
 ワカバ「Anne!
 If Ein's actor doesn't show up...」
 st00_e00
 v00an0591
 アンジ「Don't worry, even if I'm short a retainer or two, I'll find a way to manage somehow.」
 When Wakaba had asked that question before the play's start, Angelina had answered that with marvelous confidence.

 Can we really get through this audience scene without Ein being present?

 v00an0592

 Though this won't be ad-lib, since I'm just switching the lines in the script for the ones I'd come up with after discussing the possibility with Angelina earlier that Ein's actor would not arrive.

 Why is Marion playing as Ein!?
 That long, wavy hair of hers had turned from yellow to black.
 As this unexpected character appeared, not only I, but the whole audience had fallen silent.

 v09fa0038
 ファビ「...Of course.」
 I am the mastermind of the conspiracy, the one whose target is the princess.
 And before my eyes stands the man who protects her.
 Of course, I already know the outcome of this conflict.
 Even if I were to ad-lib, I knew the winner would not change.
 But, just for now―
 ev033b

 ファビ「(―Ein, I'm sure you would do the same...)」
 As an actor, and as Valery.
 To win the battle against Ein Ronberg, I shall continue to fight on!

 Then, from ‘The Tragedy of the White Kingdom's Downfall’ which the Red and Blue Kingdoms' conspire to engineer, the focus of the play shifted to the relationship between Christina and Schwester. 
 
 
 After that, not only did Ein not betray the princess, he also arranged for the princess and her beloved Schwester to escape from pursuit...

 Before she was able to do that, Christina was the one who lost her balance―
 At that moment, the angel reached her hands, and caught Christina before she fall.
 
 In truth, if we were to refer to the script, the angel should be the one falling into the arms of the princess.

 Tonino and Silvia seemed to be having fun as they messed around together. But then, after Silvia rejected him, he said something.

 Dua said, as she poked Tonino with her sword until he flinched.
 ...Yup, I saw that happen long, long ago.
 At that time, it wasn't Tonino, but Hans.
 Had Hans done something that had made Dua mad at that time too?
 According to Cero, he'd even written ‘I'm sorry’ in his diary.
 As I watched them behaving that way, I felt someone patting my head.

 v11re0195
 レイン「...‘―The princess was murdered by Ein. He took the treasure and fled.’ That's all.」
 v11re0196
 レイン「I felt a sense of responsibility, and continued my research because of that...」
 
 My real name is Ein Ronberg.
 But I was not the regent of the White Kingdom... I was just a migrant from overseas.
 I was a clown before I came to this country.
 My stage name at that time had been Rein Helmer.
 All I'd done was add an ‘R’ to the front of my real name.
 
 
 There was only one reason I was forced to make a living under a stage name.
 
 
 
 With the same name as the famed traitor Ein Ronberg, I was unable to find a job, and was harassed constantly for no reason.
 
 At first, I had hated Ein.
 I had came all the way to this land to seek refuge from war.
 But instead, I had suffered a fate more brutal than that of my homeland.
 Thus, I changed my name to Rein Helmer.
 Even though I disliked the fact that I had to live under a fake name rather than my true one...
 I had become a doll engineer regardless of that, honed my skills, and slowly climbed to the apex of the profession.
 
 ...By doing so, I was able to participate in the Dorn's Memory Revival Project.
 I had studied Efa's original design, and created a new body for her.
 And then, I transferred all the gems to that new body that had once dwelled within Efa's body.
 The project's supposed purpose was to revitalize the doll technology that was slipping into obsolescence, but what we had actually done... was but a crude act of disrespect for the dead.
 
 Even so, there was a reason that I had continued participating in that project, even becoming the core member of it.
 
 I had speculated that if the new Efa awoke to the sight of a woman that looked much like Christina, there would be a greater possibility of recovering her memories.
 
 Thus, a person who looked like Christina Dorn was chosen from among the community of doll engineers- a woman named Root, who was a colleague of mine.
 
 At the conference where I had met her, I had fallen in love at first sight. 
 That was the main reason I had taken up this project.
 Now that I recalled, I was so naive and foolish at that time...
 ...But the time I had spent with her back then had been everything to me.
 I had revived Efa's body, and Root had awakened Efa's heart.
 Regrettably, that marked the end of our collaboration, since soon after that came a ruthless order from the country that the project be stopped.
 
 They did not care about the results of the project, and wanted only to abandon doll engineering.
 
 In exchange for a large sum of money, I was forced to promise to never speak of this project again, and we were separated from each other to eke out what future we could.
 
 
 ...If she's still alive right now...
 I'm sure she must be very cute, even as an old grandmother.
 Lastly, I shall tell you the secret I have kept to myself.
 I've betrayed this country without anyone's knowledge.
 You know, that grave of Ein Ronberg's in the White Kingdom?
 His remains are not there.
 I stole them away. Why, you ask? It is because I wanted to bury him in the graveyard in Silberg.
 
 Though regrettably, this grave did not had his name carved upon it, I felt that it was a hundred times better... than being trod upon for all eternity.
 
 And then, when the time comes for me to die and enter that grave.
 In accordance with my will, I wish my real name to be written upon that gravestone.
 That was my final request as a national treasure.

 v00an1582
 アンジ「Even I... will become the same way as you are.」
 As I'd thought, I couldn't hide the embarrassment of saying that with my own mouth, and my face grew hot.
 v01be1292
 ベル「Miss Angelina... you will too?」
 v00an1583
 アンジ「Yeah... if you would let me feel it too.」
 v01be1293

 ベル「Ah, u, um, um!」
 v01be1295
 ベル「I-if that's the case, let me... let me do it too!」
 So that she didn't worry, I'd explained it to her once more with a smile, but she'd interrupted.
 v00an1585
 アンジ「W-wait, calm down, what do you mean by let you do it too?」
 Belle suddenly sat up, and said.
 ev041q
 v01be1296
 ベル「P-please... let me make you... feel it too, Miss Angelina.」
 She said something like that with an adorable expression.
 v00an1586
 アンジ「...!」
 Her face turned red in an instant, as if it seemed she'd realized what she said.
 v01be1297
 ベル「Ah, s-sorry, I... I've said too much...」
 v01be1298
 ベル「Please forget that I said that just now...」
 v00an1587
 アンジ「W-wait, why are you saying that?」
 I hurriedly said as I saw Belle growing depressed.
 v01be1298_2
 ベル「That's because... you looked troubled when I said that... Miss Angelina.」
 It seemed like she had misunderstood the reaction I had earlier.
 v01be1299
 ベル「That's why, I'm sorry...」
 v00an1589
 アンジ「You're so darn cute!」

 I brought my face close to Belle's at a distance shorter than ever before, looked into her eyes, and whispered to her.

 アンジ「Sure... let me feel it...」
 v01be1301
 ベル「B-but...」
 v00an1591
 アンジ「Don't say ‘but’ anymore... please do it.」
 I gave a quick kiss to her cheek, and her eyes widened in surprise for an instant.
 
 v01be1302
 ベル「Yes, please leave it to me,」
 she replied happily.

 v00an1592
 アンジ「Aah...」
 v01be1303
 ベル「Nn... chuu...」
 Belle was fully naked after stripping off her soaked panties.
 Her smooth tongue touched me lightly... just from that, the pleasure I felt was enough to make my eyes blur.
 
 v01be1304
 ベル「Chuu... mmchuu... nnh...」
 ev055c
 v00an1593
 アンジ「Fuaa... ngh...」
 Even though I tried to endure it, in the end I couldn't stop my voice from coming out.

 ベル「Nch chuu... how is it...? Miss Angelina...」
 
 ev055b
 v00an1594
 アンジ「Ahh... this is really... ahh... embarrassing.」
 I replied with my honest feelings to Belle's question.
 The part of myself where even I'd never taken a close look... was being touched by Belle right now.
 
 ev055f
 v01be1306
 ベル「Fwch... nchuu... chu...」
 ev055g
 v00an1595
 アンジ「Hyaau!」
 Suddenly, a warm and damp sensation appeared between my legs. This unknown feeling forced me to release the moans that I had been trying desperately to hold back.
 
 v01be1307
 ベル「Nghh... fwch nch... chuu...」
 v00an1596
 アンジ「Fuaa... nhaa... ammnn... ahh...!」
 Then, I noticed this continuous stimulation without a doubt originated from what Belle was doing with her tongue.

 v00an1597
 アンジ「S-stop, if you lick there... auu...」
 v01be1308
 ベル「Nn... fwch... ncch... Does it... chu... feel good?」
 She asked that amidst the gentle movements of her tongue.

 ベル「Then... fwch... shhchuu... what's the... problem?」
 ev055f
 v00an1599
 アンジ「T-that place... kyauu... i-is dirty...」
 Gradually, the pleasure from below spread throughout my body.
 Honestly, I didn't want her to stop...
  It's just that it was too embarrassing, so I had to say that.
 v01be1310
 ベル「Nch fwch... nn... Don't worry... fwch fwch...」
 v01be1311
 ベル「There is nothing... nmmu... dirty about... your body, Miss Angelina...」
 ev055g
 v00an1600
 アンジ「Fuaa... nnh...!」
 After saying that, the movements of her tongue became more and more intense.
  I was lost among the waves of stimulation.
 v01be1312
 ベル「Ahh... nch... please relax... nhn...」
 v01be1313
 ベル「And enjoy everything... I'm giving... fwch fwch.」
 ev055f
 v00an1601
 アンジ「Ahh... why am I... nn... ugh...」
 I was powerless against this sensation that I had never encountered before.
  Still, my heart surged with emotion from the knowledge that Belle was doing this for me.

 v00an1603
 アンジ「Augh... Y-your tongue... i-is moving inside me... Ahhn...!」
 My head was drowned in the pleasure, commanding my whole body to pursue the stimulation Belle was giving me.
 
 v01be1316
 ベル「Nchuu... nn... nn... ah...」
 With a small sound, she stopped the movements of her tongue,
 ev055e
 v01be1317
 ベル「So it... really is true...」
 and murmured, seeming happy for some reason.
 v00an1604
 アンジ「Eh?」
 v01be1318
 ベル「You're getting wet here too... Miss Angelina...」
 v01be1319
 ベル「Just like me... so it is true...」
 As she said that, I realized that there were warm fluids flowing from my important part... my face reddened that she'd pointed it out to me.

 アンジ「I-isn't that obvious? ...Why would I lie to... ahhn!」

 Fuaa!」
 v01be1321
 ベル「I'm so happy... nccfwch... nchpa... nch...」
 v00an1607
 アンジ「Auu... nhah... ngh...!」
 For a while she kissed me gently, and for a while she licked passionately, both of them Belle's neverending effort to provide me with pleasure. 
 
 I would really like to stay engrossed in this pleasure, but I mustn't. I can't be the only one being satisfied. 
 
 ev055h
 v00an1608
 アンジ「H-hey... w-wait... wait a bit...」
 v01be1322
 ベル「Chuu... Miss Angelina?」
 ev055i
 v00an1609
 アンジ「Auu...」
 As her lips separated from me, my body immediately felt intoxicated. Still engrossed by the lingering pleasure, I gave her a suggestion.
 
 ev055h
 v00an1610
 アンジ「Isn't it about time... we try to make us both... feel good together?」
 v01be1323
 ベル「Together...?」
 v00an1611
 アンジ「That's right, at first it was me, now it's you. So we should be doing it together next, right?」
 I had made Belle feel good, and Belle had made me feel good, but just that wasn't enough.
 
 v00an1612
 アンジ「Let's do it together... so we could feel much much more better together.」
 v01be1324
 ベル「...Yes, I want to feel... more of you too, Miss Angelina.」
 Our desire is the same.
  We wanted to touch each other more, and feel each other more.
  And thus... confirming each other's feelings. That was all we wanted.

 v01be1325
 ベル「Ah......」
 Belle gently lied down, her symbolic wing spread out upon the bed.
 
 v00an1613
 アンジ「Ngh...」
 There was no need for words any longer.
  I softly laid my own body on top of Belle's.
 v01be1326
 ベル「Aahh... Miss Angelina... your body is so hot...」
 v00an1614
 アンジ「Yours too...」
 Our skin was burning with passion as it came into contact.
 Because of what we'd done earlier, our bodies were covered with sweat.
 ev042c
 v01be1327
 ベル「Aahh... nn... ngh...!」
 v00an1615
 アンジ「Fuaa... nghaa... nn... ahn!」
 As I moved atop her, I wrapped my legs around hers. Our wet parts rubbed against each other, and obscene sounds were the result.
 
 
 ev042b
 v01be1328
 ベル「Auu... ngah... ahh... ah...!」
 v00an1616
 アンジ「Haa haa... ahh... nnngh...!」
 Losing myself, I lusted only for Belle's body, and gradually increased the speed of my hips as they moved.

 v01be1330

 アンジ「Me, me... too... nggh...」
 v00an1618
 アンジ「Your body... really... makes me feel... really good...」
 I didn't know when it had started, but Belle was moving her hips as one with mine. It was a natural action, something that only increased our pleasure.
 
 
 ev042e
 v01be1331
 ベル「Nghaaa... I-I... I love you... Miss... Angelina...」
 v00an1619
 アンジ「I... I... I love you... too.」
 The words that naturally came from our lips combined with our body language to share our love.
 
 And then, as if she hoped we could become even closer, Belle made an unexpected request.

 v01be1332
 ベル「M-my name... aahh...!
 My name...」
 v00an1620
 アンジ「Ngh... haa haa... eh?」
 v01be1333
 ベル「P-please... call my name... nghaa!」
 Beneath me, Belle begged that of me in a plaintive voice.
 v00an1621
 アンジ「Belle... Belle...!」
 ―I must have been waiting... waiting for this moment. The moment when I could call her name.
 
 v00an1622
 アンジ「I love, I love you, Belle... Belle...!」
 v01be1334
 ベル「Aah... Angelina, I-I'm so happy...!」
 Our feelings of love, which had been growing until now, flowed out at that moment as if a dam had broken.
 v00an1623
 アンジ「Belle... ngghuu... Belle...!」
 v00an1624
 アンジ「This, this feels good... Belle... au...!」

 v00an1625
 アンジ「Nghuu... nn... ah... aahn...!」
 v01be1336
 ベル「Aah... more, more...!」
 We continued calling out each others' names as we both drowned within this dreamlike pleasure.
 
 All my senses were melting, I felt like my body was becoming one with hers.
 
 And deep down inside my body, I sensed a steaming hot wave of pleasure I'd never felt before in my life swiftly approaching.
 
 v00an1626
 アンジ「Fuaaa... I-I... can't... I can't hold...」

 As her voice trembled, it made it clear her limit was approaching too.
 v00an1628
 アンジ「L-let's... let's come together... p-please... nngghhaa!」
 v01be1339
 ベル「Y-yes, yes... auuuu!」
 We held tight on to each other's bodies, and continued violently rubbing ourselves on each other.
 At that instant,

 Breathing heavily, I slowly relaxed.

 And then, with that same breath, I whispered into her ear,

 Just after I whispered that to her, I closed my eyes in exhaustion.

 アンジ「...Belle!」
 I took her icy body into my arms, trying to transfer as much body heat to her as possible.
 
 v01be1342
 ベル「Miss... Angelina.」
 The sensation of her breath sweetly departing from her mouth was enough to make my mind go numb.
 Even though I knew that now wasn't the time for something like this... even though my heart would not allow me to...
 
 v00an1633
 アンジ「...Belle... nnm...」
 v01be1343
 ベル「Nnmm...」
 As her mouth met mine, not only were her lips more softer than I expected, they were burning hot.
 I was the one who should be trying to warm her up... but the sensation of her lips threatened to make me melt...
 v00an1634
 アンジ「...Ah, nnm...」
 She wrapped her arms around me, and slowly arched her back, adding more intensity to her hug as her hands slid up to my shoulders.
 
 v01be1344
 ベル「...I am... Belle...」
 I felt powerless to answer the words that left her lips... there was nothing I could do other than to nod back, and stroke her hair.

 I didn't know why.

  She was asking desperately for my help.

 v00an1637
 アンジ「...Why are you behaving like a child? Weren't you alone while I was gone yesterday and the day before?」
 v01be1346
 ベル「That's right. But, today... is different.」
 v00an1638
 アンジ「...How is it different?」
 v01be1347
 ベル「I felt like... you wouldn't be coming back anymore, Miss Angelina.」
 v00an1639
 アンジ「...You silly. What reason would I have for not coming back?」
 v01be1348
 ベル「...If I weren't Belle anymore, then...」
 ―Not Belle anymore?
 v00an1640
 アンジ「If you weren't Belle, then who else could you be?」
 v01be1349
 ベル「......」
 v00an1641
 アンジ「See, it's just as I said. You can't be anyone other than Belle―」
 v01be1350
 ベル「...Your Highness...」
 As if to rebut what I said, she spoke of someone who only existed in history and the script of a play.
 
 Then, she took me hostage by looking directly into my eyes,
 v01be1351
 ベル「...You're Her Highness, right?」
  and asked.
 v00an1642
 アンジ「Don't say something so weird. It's not practice time right now, so I'm Angelina, right?」
 
 v01be1352
 ベル「No... Your Highness, have you forgotten me?」
 v00an1643
 アンジ「There's no way I could forget you. You're...」
 Just as I say that, I realize that Belle's body had started to gradually warm up.
 v00an1644
 アンジ「―Belle?」
 v01be1353
 ベル「...I want to be by Her Highness's side, forever.」
 v01be1354
 ベル「Even if we're apart, at least our hearts... will still be together.」
 v01be1355
 ベル「But, then I realized that was just my fantasy.」
 Those words were as if lines from ‘The Angel's Guidance.’
 But no such lines existed in either the original or in Wakaba's script.
 v01be1356
 ベル「...Only when Her Highness is by my side will she truly be Her Highness to me.」
 v01be1357
 ベル「If that is not possible... then I'll...」
 v00an1645
 アンジ「...Mmh!」
 Belle lifted her lips and pressed them against mine.
 v00an1646
 アンジ「...Ah... B-Belle...?」
 And then, just like that, she slowly pushed her tongue between my lips, making it difficult for me to breathe.
 v01be1358
 ベル「...Mmah... mmm...」
 As her tongue invaded the deepest parts of my mouth, she made it impossible for me to escape or even to think properly.
 
 v00an1647
 アンジ「...Ah, n-no... stop...」
 v01be1359
 ベル「Why, do you... refuse... me...?」
 v00an1648
 アンジ「W-why are you... doing something, like this...」
 v01be1360
 ベル「Do you dislike it?」
 The moment my eyes closed, she pulled her tongue out from my mouth.
 But without thinking, I pursued it.
 v00an1649
 アンジ「...Mmh, mmm...」
  I captured her lips with my own.
 v01be1361
 ベル「...Your Highness.」
 Her cheeks, made moist by our rough kiss, were left glossy by the passage of my burning tongue.
 Belle raised her arm, wiped her cheeks,
 v01be1362
 ベル「My beloved princess...」
  and murmured that.
 v00an1650
 アンジ「...Belle... I...」
 v01be1363
 ベル「I am... not Belle. Have you forgotten my name?」
 v01be1364
 ベル「I am... Efa...」

 アンジ「...Efa?」

 アンジ「Who is this, Your Highness... you mean?」
 v01be1366
 ベル「Princess Christina...」
 v00an1653
 アンジ「I am not Christina, but... Angelina.」
 v00an1654
 アンジ「And you are Belle!」
 v01be1367

 As she said that, she struggled free from my arms.
 And just like that, she started running towards the bottom of the bridge.
  I hurriedly chased after her.

 Her warm lips softly touched my breast.
 Our bodies wet from the rain, though cold before, were now burning with passion.

 Belle slowly reached out her hands, sliding them down my body.

 She kept on kissing my breast, over and over, and her hands did not stop either.

 After easing the tension in my entrance by stroking in a circular movement, she slowly pushed her fingers inside my body.

 It was as if something warm, gentle, and full of life were fondling me.
 That something was none other than Belle's tongue.

 Belle lusted for my body... I could have never imagined her acting this way from her usual behavior.
 But, it might be because she was trying to prove something. Trying to prove that she exists, right here and now.
 v01be1385
 ベル「Fua... you're... getting more wet than before over here...」

 アンジ「Ngh... haa haa... aun... ngh...!」
 Her fingers were pumping inside me violently, making an obscene, wet sound as they did.
 The walls inside my body were being stroked again and again, making me feel as if there was an electric current flowing through my spine.

 v00an1683
 アンジ「...Of course I would.」
 v00an1684

 To let my true feelings reach Belle, I said that in a clear voice that the sound of the rain could not muffle.
 And in reply to my confession,

  Belle nodded deeply.

 And then, without stopping, she reached her fingers inside of me and started to stir me up.
 Each and every one of her actions expressed her feelings for me, and they filled my whole body.

 v01be1397

 Our bodies were embracing each other. At this moment, we had became one.
 All of my mind had been saturated with the pleasure Belle was bringing me.
 v00an1691
 アンジ「Haa haa... B-Belle... I-I... ngh...」
 v01be1398
 ベル「Chuuu... nn... fwchfwch...」
 v01be1399
 ベル「Fua... Angelina... Angelina...!」
 Her middle finger penetrated me strongly, and at the same time, her thumb pressed the spot where I was most sensitive.
 v00an1692
 アンジ「Fua!?
 Aaaaaah!」

 The unexpected stimulation sent my mind blank.
 And then, somewhere deep inside my body, a wave of burning hot pleasure exploded.
 v00an1693
 アンジ「Auu... haa haa...」
 My body felt totally out of energy.
 But, as I was about to fall down in exhaustion, Belle gently embraced me.

 ベル「Angelina... thank you...」
 And finally, she whispered that to my ears once more.
 Even though we were surrounded by the sound of the pouring rain, that did not stop her words from reaching me.

 Did you bring the bread?
 The milk?
 And the picnic sheet?」
 v01be1401
 ベル「Yes, I brought them all.」
 This was the morning of our day off, now that we'd gotten accustomed to staying in Moosgrun.
 v00an1695
 アンジ「...Even if it's just once, I've always wanted to have a picnic while we're here.」

 With ‘taking a walk’ as an excuse, I took Belle with me to a small hill near Cero's house.
 
 v00an1696
 アンジ「In the Blue Capital, even though there's the ocean nearby, there are hardly any hills.」
 v00an1697
 アンジ「Well, of course I'll be lying if I said there were none at all, but there certainly isn't any landscape as serene as this.」
 
 st01_a01
 v01be1403
 ベル「Ufufufu.」
 v00an1698
 アンジ「Don't you feel that way too?」
 st01_a00
 v01be1404
 ベル「Well, I live in the countryside, so I can enjoy this anytime.」
 To make sure we had a clear view of the streets at Moosgrun, we headed to the highest spot on that hill, and laid ourselves a perfect seat.
 
 As the gentle breeze passed by, it tried but failed to carry away the picnic sheet we had spread. Just like that, we started enjoying our time leisurely.
 
 v00an1699
 アンジ「The bread from Wakaba's shop is really delicious.」
 st01_a01
 v01be1405
 ベル「You're right.」
 With bread and milk in our hands, we started reminiscing upon the journey that had brought us to this town.
 
 Belle was from Silberg.
 ―And I was from the Blue Capital.
 In idle conversation, we told each other what had happened during the times when we weren't together... and then, naturally, we asked each other for more details. 
 
 We spoke of the things we had done, and the things we had wanted to do.
 As our conversation drifted through the past that we can never return to...
  I started worrying about the future.
 v00an1700
 アンジ「Hey, Belle. So when this play ends, you're really going to...」
 st01_a00
 v01be1406
 ベル「I'll be going back to Silberg.」
 ...Though I had expected that answer, I still couldn't help but ask about our impossible future together.
 
 v01be1407
 ベル「You asked about that before, too. Is there anything wrong?」
 Faced with such straightforward words, I was hesitant to admit my reluctance to see her leave.
 
 v00an1701
 アンジ「...Y-yeah...」
 I felt slightly envious, and a little irritated, that she was able to express her feelings so easily.
 
 st01_a05
 v01be1408
 ベル「Your face is red. Could you have a feve...」
 v00an1702
 アンジ「No, of course not. I wasn't talking about that!」
 Getting emotional, I tried to push away Belle's arm as she reached towards me in sympathy.
 ...But instead, my hand somehow ended up joining with hers.
 
 v00an1703
 アンジ「Y-you know, Belle!
 If it's possible, do you want to... live together with me?」
 
 I didn't let go of her hand, and looked straight at her, waiting for her answer for my confession.
 For a while, she said nothing and looked at me blankly, then slowly lowered her gaze to the grass beside the sheet.
 
 st01_a00
 v01be1409
 ベル「...Are you serious?」
 v00an1704
 アンジ「Of course, I wouldn't joke about something like that.」
 st01_a03
 v01be1410
 ベル「I'm really, really happy. But...」
 If I gave up at the sight of Belle's gloomy expression and returned to where we had started, I would never make any progress.
 
 v00an1705
 アンジ「You... can't?」
 By adding more strength to my words, I tried to coax her true feelings from her.
 v01be1411
 ベル「I would not mind. But, Miss Angelina... you would surely regret that.」
 v00an1706
 アンジ「I'm the one who brought this up, so of course I wouldn't regret it.」
 I thought about making a joke to defuse the awkward atmosphere... but after consideration, I resisted the urge to doing that.
 
 That's because... a sense of melancholy had filled her eyes.
 st01_a02
 v01be1412
 ベル「...Do you really think so?」
 v00an1707
 アンジ「...Yeah, if people are afraid of regretting everything they do, only then will their lives become depressing.」
 
 
 
 Though I meant to take the conversation in a more positive direction, I realized that was like something Wakaba would say.
 
 Still, even if I borrowed Wakaba's optimism... I wasn't able to borrow her smile.
 
 st01_a03
 v01be1413
 ベル「...What I fear... is time.」
 v00an1708
 アンジ「Eh?」
 v01be1414
 ベル「Time is cruel. I am a Sister, and you are a human, Miss Angelina.」
 
 
 
 v01be1415
 ベル「―Time will surely flow by us before we know it.」
 st01_a14
 v01be1416
 ベル「If we wait until that time comes, it will be too late. So... if we can, we should...」
 
 v00an1709
 アンジ「Dummy!」
 I shouted that on impulse, not wanting to hear any more of her worries.

 v00an1710
 アンジ「Don't you remember what I said in Vermilion?」
 v00an1711
 アンジ「I'm not going to just brush past you.」
 I gave her no time to come up with a rebuttal.
 v00an1712
 アンジ「I'm going to always, always be together with you, and continue onwards by your side.」
 I wanted to let her know that my feelings were true.
 v00an1713
 アンジ「I thought the very same on that day!
 That's why I've always been together with you up until now...」
 I believed that the time we had spent together was the strongest evidence.
 st01_a03
 v01be1418
 ベル「...Miss Angelina.」
 v00an1714
 アンジ「As long as you don't hate me!
 I want to stay by your side.」
 I didn't want to be a nuisance to Belle, it's just that, if she's willing―
 st01_a00
 v01be1419
 ベル「...Don't worry. I like you, Miss Angelina. There's no way I would hate you.」
 
 v00an1715
 アンジ「...Really?」
 st01_a01
 v01be1420
 ベル「Have I ever lied to you until now?」
 Watching her smiling quietly, on impulse, I took her lips with mine.
 Not giving any resistance, she accepted me, still...
 v00an1716
 アンジ「...But I am a little worried.」
 I let my honest thoughts issue from my mouth.
 st01_a05
 v01be1421
 ベル「Eh?」
 v00an1717
 アンジ「You can't promise that you'll never fall in love with another person, right?」
 Those words were feelings that would never have come out if it weren't this kind of time.
 Of course, though I too wished to hope that would not happen―
 st01_a03
 v01be1422
 ベル「...You might be right.」
 If she herself did not deny it, the seed of unease inside me would never disappear.
 
 v00an1718
 アンジ「Dummy. At these kind of times, you should be more considerate...」
 I complained at her honesty, as beside me, Belle leaned on my shoulders.
 
 st01_a02
 v01be1423
 ベル「The first person I fell in love with... was you, Miss Angelina.」
 v01be1424
 ベル「That's why, if I were to fall in love with someone else... that person couldn't be anyone but you.」
 Those deep words, along with the soft sensation upon my shoulders, had created a tremendous wave within my heart.
 
 v00an1719
 アンジ「What do you mean by that?」
 st01_a00
 v01be1425
 ベル「...My Drop shall never forget you.」
 
 
 st01_a02
 v01be1426
 ベル「Our parents and our first love... we shall never be able to forget them. That is the fate of we Sisters.」
 
 
 
 
 
 She raised her head from my shoulders to my neck, as she whispered that into my ear.
 v00an1720
 アンジ「...Belle...」
 st01_a11
 v01be1427
 ベル「That's why... Miss Angelina. Please do not forget me.」
 And at that moment, I was taken hostage by her moist eyes.
 v00an1721
 アンジ「Of course I'll never forget you. Even if you want me to forget, I will never... ever...」
 My heart desired everything of her―

 v00an1723
 アンジ「Oh, that won't do. If we did that, then I couldn't see your body.」
 v01be1430
 ベル「But... in this kind of place, I...」
 As she became embarrassed, an indescribable feeling of adoration rose within me.
 I took her delicate body into my arms.
 v01be1431
 ベル「A-Angelina...」
 Though I didn't really like taking advantage of our conversation to do this, now that it's come to this, I had not the rationality left to stop myself.
 
 v00an1724
 アンジ「Is it shameful for you to let me see everything of you?」
 v01be1432
 ベル「Eh, t-that's... no.」

 アンジ「Mmh... chuu...」
 ev046e
 v01be1434
 ベル「Chu... nchuu... fwch...」
 We kissed each other, again and again, like lovebirds.
 As her thumping heartbeat transferred through her chest to me as we hugged, I replied it with my own thumping heartbeat.

 v00an1727
 アンジ「Mmh... chuuu... fufu... Belle...」
 v00an1728
 アンジ「Hey, try saying... my name.」

 Belle cutely called my name.
 In response, I kissed her back deeply.

 I gently caressed her back, and her shoulders trembled in response.
 Watching such an adorable reaction, I couldn't help but laugh.
 v00an1731
 アンジ「Really, I can't help but feel so envious... nch...」
 v01be1438
 ベル「Auu... nn... if it's about that, Angelina, you also...」
 v01be1439
 ベル「Have a really... beautiful body... and soft too... nchu...」
 When she said that, as if to imitate what I was doing, she caressed my back.
 The sensation of her slim hand tracing along my spine sent shivers throughout my body. 
 ev046f
 v01be1440
 ベル「Touching you like this... I feel like I could do this forever...」
 She said that while looking at me with passionate eyes.
 Ah... that was an expression of Belle's that only I was permitted to see.

 Our lips pressed against each other, our tongues entangled.
 The sensation of her tongue was making my mind numb.

 アンジ「Fua... nn... Belle, you're good at kissing.」

 アンジ「Yes, it feels really good... chuu...」
 ev046i
 v01be1444
 ベル「Nmu... fwch... nch nch...」
 Never growing fatigued, we kept on kissing each other, again and again.
 Within this deserted forest, only the sounds of our tongues entwined with each other were heard.
 v01be1445
 ベル「Ah... fuaaa...!」
 v00an1737
 アンジ「Ngh...!」
 The sudden stimulation that came to Belle and I made us separate from our kiss and moan.
 The source of that was the friction of the tips of our breasts.
 ev046f
 v01be1446
 ベル「Mm... Angelina... you've gotten hard...」
 v00an1738
 アンジ「I-I... haven't you too?」
 I frantically replied Belle's words,
 as if it would be embarrassing that I'm the only one that felt good.
 v01be1447

 ベル「Feels good here too... nn!
 H-how wonderful...」
 ev046i
 v00an1739
 アンジ「Ah... i-if you... press yourself to me like that... ahn!」
 Belle was moving her chest against me, making our nipples rub against each other.
 The abrasiveness of that was enough to push me near my limits.
 v01be1449
 ベル「Nchuu... Angelina... fwch... nn.」
 v00an1740
 アンジ「Fua... nch fwch... auuu...」
 She lusted for my lips, all the while not forgetting to rub her breast against mine.
 The rapidly accelerating pleasure was burning my body as if I were feverish.

 ベル「Ncchu chu... nchu... hau... chuu...」
 v00an1741
 アンジ「Nn... fwchfwch... chuu... nmu...」
 Belle was sucking on my lips, and I was doing the same back to her.
 This is incredible... the more we kissed each other, the more we knew how to increase our own pleasure.
 v01be1451
 ベル「Nchuu... fwch... chuuchuu... nchuu...!」
 v00an1742

 I kissed her, deeper and stronger, until my forehead brushed against the hair covering Belle's.
 That soft and fluffy sensation felt pleasant.

 Her small and smooth tongue entwined with mine, not letting go.

 I have never known until now.

 ベル「Nn... fua... Angelina...」

 アンジ「...Fwch... Belle?」
 Slowly, Belle parted from my lips.
 From those very lips that separated so reluctantly from the embrace of our tongues, she said.
 v01be1455
 ベル「I-I...」
 I could feel the beating of Belle's heart.
 She stuttered, twisted her hips, and looked up at me shyly.
 v00an1746
 アンジ「Could it be, that you're... not satisfied just by kissing?」
 v01be1456
 ベル「...Yes.」
 As she said that with feverish breath, she nodded in embarrassment.
 Even though we had shared such passionate kisses, she was still unexpectedly shy.
 v00an1747
 アンジ「Fufu, I got it... then, shall we?」
 ev046i
 v01be1457
 ベル「Ah... nmu...」
 I gave one final kiss to her, and laid our bodies down.

 v01be1458

 I sat down just like that, leaning with my back against a tree.
 While Belle, on the other hand, leaned towards my body.

 アンジ「Nn... this way, we can be much closer to each other.」

 Belle raised her hips.
 As I moved my hands across her hips, my fingers reached for her most important part.

 v01be1461

 I slowly stretched open the entrance between her thighs with my fingers.
 And then... started rubbing around it.
 v01be1462
 ベル「Ahn... ngh... ahn... aah...!」
 In rhythm with my finger movements came her cute reactions.
 Slowly, hot juices started flowing out from her insides.

 ベル「Nchuu... fwch... ngh... ahn...」
 v00an1752

 Engrossed, we embraced each other and savored the pleasure we were giving each other's bodies.

 ev047h
 v01be1468

 Kyau... n-not there... haa!」
 I twirled my finger around her most sensitive area, hidden within her.
 And when I did that, Belle reacted violently.
 ev047b
 v01be1469
 ベル「Hyau... no... n-not there... ahh...」
 v01be1470
 ベル「D-don't... play with it... with your... fingers...!」
 The more I rubbed it, the more hot juices flowed out from her insides.
 She twisted her body, while letting out a sweet moan.

 アンジ「Ah, nn, B-Belle...」
 v01be1471

 As I watched her enjoying herself and doing her best to kiss me, I was overjoyed.

 アンジ「Ngh, i-is it really... that good?」
 My fingers started pumping into her.
 The moment I went inside her, she was squeezing me so tightly it almost hurt.

 v01be1473
 ベル「Ah, hyauuuu!
 Ngh!
 Ngahhh!」
 As I rubbed against the walls of her sensitive area, she reacted violently.
 v00an1758

 v01be1474
 ベル「Auu...!
 Ahhn!
 T-that's...」
 v00an1759
 アンジ「Come on, you can't do that, Belle... keep your voice lower.」
 Though I whispered that to her, my finger movements increased in intensity.

 v01be1475
 ベル「Kyaah... n-no way... it's impossible... fuaa!」
 v01be1476
 ベル「I-I... can't... help my voice... ngahh...!」
 As I eased my fingering at her sensitive spot, she arched her back, and just like that, she kept on panting raggedly.
 
 v01be1477
 ベル「Haa haa haa...」
 v00an1760
 アンジ「Ah, are you okay...?
 Belle.」
 Wondering if I had gotten too carried away and overdone it, I stopped the movements of my fingers.
 ev047k
 v01be1478
 ベル「Y-you're... such a bully, Angelina...」
 v00an1761
 アンジ「Sorry, I couldn't help it, since you were being too cute...」
 That wasn't an excuse, but what I truly thought.
 After saying that, Belle's cheeks grew red instantly.
 v01be1479
 ベル「Y-you're so mean... saying something like that...」
 v00an1762
 アンジ「Fufu, but it's true.」
 ev047d
 v01be1480
 ベル「Ah...」
 I softly caressed Belle's head.
 The feeling of her smooth hair beneath my palm made me feel pleasant.
 ev047c
 v00an1763
 アンジ「It's your fault for being so cute.」
 v01be1481
 ベル「Nn...」
 As I caressed her head, she let out a content voice.
 That's right... even her current reaction was adorable.
 ev047d
 v01be1482
 ベル「Angelina... Angelina...」
 As she called out my name wistfully, she leaned her body towards mine.
 It felt as if, should I accidentally use too much strength, I might break her.
 Still, I embraced her tightly.
 v01be1483
 ベル「Nn... chuu... Angelina...」
 ev047b
 v00an1764
 アンジ「Belle... ahn... nn... ngh...」
 Belle reached for my neck once more and kissed it.
 No matter how close she is to me, I still couldn't feel satisfied.
 That's why, we hugged, our bodies pressed against each other...
 ...and hoped, that this moment would continue forever, and ever.
 ev047a
 v01be1484
 ベル「Chuu... Angelina... let's do it together again...」

 There was no reason for me to reject her invitation.

 アンジ「Doesn't... your back hurt?」
 v01be1485
 ベル「No, there's no problem.」
 As we returned to the sheet we were sitting on earlier, I let Belle slowly lie down on it.
 
 ev056a
 v00an1767
 アンジ「Then, Belle...」
 ev056c
 v01be1486

 She nodded in response to my words.
 After getting her permission, I placed my important part against hers.

 v00an1768
 アンジ「Nn...」
 v01be1487
 ベル「Auu...」
 As she was already wet, we made an indecent sound as we came into contact.
 But, I couldn't blame her for that.
 Since, I had realized
 
  that I was as wet as her.

 As our bodies combined into one, we felt more intimate with each other.
 We felt much more complete than we had before.

 I'm sure Belle was feeling the same way as I was, thus in response to her words, I sped up.

 v00an1773
 アンジ「T-that's a relief... I'm... ngh... feeling good too...!」
 Before we knew it, both of our important parts were wet, covered with our own juices.
 Our warm juices mixed with each other, and flowed down our thighs.
 That was... the evidence that we're becoming one.

 v01be1495
 ベル「Aah... Angelina... more... more...!」
 v01be1496
 ベル「Do it... to me more... nghh... fuaa...」
 An expression that others could never see normally, a lustful voice that she would never let slip.
 These were the side of Belle that I alone was permitted to see.

 アンジ「Ah... kuu...!」
 ev056c
 v01be1498
 ベル「Angelina... ahn!
 Fuaa...!」
 I was rubbing the part where I was most sensitive against the area where she was.
 And the stimulation I received was far greater than I could imagine.
 My whole body was filled with pleasure, but still I did not stop moving my hips.
 ev056d
 v01be1499
 ベル「Hyauuu, s-stop, d-don't... m-my head... is going blank...!」
 v00an1776
 アンジ「Kuuu... Belle... Belle...!」
 The sound of the friction we created, rubbing against each other, echoed thoughout the quiet forest.
 Both of us were getting so wet below it was as if we were on fire, approaching our boiling point.

 アンジ「I love you... I love you so much...!」

 v01be1502
 ベル「Nghh... me too... me too...!」
 No matter how many times she said that, it wasn't enough. No matter how much we made love to each other, it wasn't enough. 
 Ah, why is the feeling of loving someone so magnificent?
 To have been able to meet the person that I loved... I felt truly blessed from the bottom of my heart.
 v01be1503

 v01be1504
 ベル「M-more... do it to me... more...!」
 ev056b
 v00an1779
 アンジ「Kuu...!」
 Matching the movements of my hips, Belle too started moving hers.
 Just like that, the pleasure we felt grew stronger.
 v00an1780
 アンジ「B-Belle... i-if you move like that... aahn...!」
 ev056c

 ベル「I-I... I'm... going to come too...!」
 ev056d
 v00an1781
 アンジ「Nnn... ngh... auu...」
 The hands with which Belle gripped on my thighs tightened.
 She was desperately resisting the waves of pleasure from flowing out of her.
 I too was enduring them, trying to make this moment last as long as I could.
 ev056a
 v00an1782
 アンジ「Nghaa... Belle... Belle...」

 But, we're almost at our limit.
 We're almost past the point of not being able to call out each other's names anymore.

 Following our words, I rubbed our sensitive areas violently.
 At that very moment, I felt a burst of pleasure deep inside my body.

 The white clover surrounding us became blurry, and my sight went fully blank.
 I surrendered my body to the wave after wave of pleasure flowing out of me.

 v01be1511
 ベル「Auu... Angelina...」
 I could hear the sound of my beloved Belle calling out my name―
 I felt the warmth of her body as she collapsed onto me, and I embraced her just like that as time passes by.

 Man, Tonino is really getting carried away.
  I flung away the clothes that I'd just stripped off, and got on top of him.
 ev053a
 v06si0179
 シルヴ「Now, what shall I do, I wonder?」
 I slowly pulled down the zipper on his pants, and coaxed out what was underneath.
 v07to0226
 トニー「...H-hey... on second thought...」
 Oh Tonino, always such a coward now that we've come this far.
  Still, I found that one of the cute things about him.
 ev053d
 I giggled at the thought.
 ev053a
 v06si0180
 シルヴ「You're the one who put your hands on me first, so why are you complaining?」
 That's right, I did tease him.
  But he's the one who made the first move.
  So, I played along.
 v07to0227
 トニー「But... don't you think the position is a little weird?」
 Seems like he didn't like being the one on the bottom.
 v07to0228
 トニー「I'm lucky to be able to do this with you, but... you know, I'd rather be on top...」
 As Tonino kept on mumbling complaints, I forced a kiss upon him to shut him up.
 v06si0181
 シルヴ「It's fine this way, idiot.」
 black450
 ev053i
 After telling him that, I started to use my fingers to play with him.
 ev053k
 v06si0182
 シルヴ「Al-right, boy. Be good.」
 I lightly toyed with the tip with my fingers, while rubbing the back part of the shaft with my palm.
 
 v06si0183
 シルヴ「...Does it feel good?」
 I don't have to ask to know the answer to that, since his reactions clearly showed his excitement. I couldn't help but feel excited too.
 v07to0229
 トニー「If you ask me so bluntly, you can't really expect me to say ‘yes’, can you?」
 ev053i
 v06si0184
 シルヴ「Hmm? Shall... I stop then?」
 v07to0230
 トニー「Please forgive me.」
 Whether he admitted it or not, he was already fully hard. So, even though he knew that resistance was impossible, he still looked at me with a pout, seeming dissatisfied.
 ev053c
 v06si0185
 シルヴ「You ought to be honest, boy.」
 v07to0231
 トニー「...First of all, would you mind not treating me like a boy?」
 Even if he does intend to protest, if that's the most he can say, all I'll do is laugh.
 
 ev053l
 v06si0186
 シルヴ「Oh, but aren't you just a little older than Light?」
 v07to0232
 トニー「Don't you mean Cero?
 Light is about ten years younger than me, you know.」
 ev053k
 v06si0187
 シルヴ「Whatever, it's all the same in my eyes... right?」
 I drew closer to Tonino's bottom half, and gave a light kiss to the tip of his shaft.
 v07to0233
 トニー「Nn... guh.」
 Electrified, his body tensed up.
 ev053i
 v06si0188
 シルヴ「Hey, Tonino?
 Do you really want to be an adult even though your body is at my mercy now?」
 The irresistible stimulation caused liquid to leak from the tip of his shaft, flowing onto the hand that roughly caressed it as if drawing a circle with a pen.
 v07to0234
 トニー「We're doing something like this that kids can't do, isn't your question entirely moot?」
 v06si0189
 シルヴ「Hmm? Are you trying to cover yourself with that shitty excuse?」
 v07to0235
 トニー「That wasn't my intention. It's just that, don't you think the difference is clear if you compare me and him?」
 ev053k
 v06si0190
 シルヴ「Eh?
 Is that so?」
 I looked carefully over Tonino's body at my leisure.
  Then, I stretched out my hand and explored his jawline.
 ev053i
 v06si0191
 シルヴ「Hm, well, your finely chiseled face is certainly different from him.」
 And I nodded as my hand experienced the bristly feel of his chin.
 v06si0192
 シルヴ「...And you have a beard too,」
 just like that, my fingers slid down his neck, and came to his chest.
 v06si0193
 シルヴ「And you've even got muscles!」
 My fingers continued to slide down, and finally reached his groin.
 ev053k
 v06si0194
 シルヴ「And down around here, there is quite a significant difference.」
 I tightly gripped onto his fully erect shaft.
 v07to0236
 トニー「Significant difference, you say... have you... seen theirs?!」
 ev053l
 v06si0195
 シルヴ「What the heck are you talking about?」
  I burst out laughing.
 ev053i
 v06si0196
 シルヴ「Obviously I know it'd be different from Light and Cero's, even without looking. More like, if theirs were the same as yours, then that would be quite a shock.」
 v07to0237
 トニー「...Who knows. It's been a long time since we've done anything like this, I thought you'd already forgotten.」
 Tonino said, grumbling.
 v06si0197
 シルヴ「Well, I don't know anything what those kids got, but yours... is at my beck and call.」
 v07to0238
 トニー「...Oh really?」
 Seems like he wasn't happy that I haven't ‘visited’ him in quite a while. I guess it is a little mean when I never give him any satisfaction because of my mood.
 
 v06si0198
 シルヴ「Ooh, I can't really hear you. ...Still, I guess maybe I did forget about you recently?」
 v07to0239
 トニー「...Oi oi.」
 Still, I'm not going to listen to his complaints.
 ev053k
 v06si0199
 シルヴ「Well, just forget about it. Aren't I doing this to you right now?」
 I lightly stroked up and down as I moistened it a little.
 
 v06si0200
 シルヴ「As an apology for what I've done all this while, I'll satisfy you today.」
 Tonight, I'll be the aggressive one... a night like this isn't bad once in a while.
 
 v07to0240
 トニー「...Well, I guess there's no way out for me today.」
 ev053i
 v06si0201
 シルヴ「Man, do you want me to say it in another way?」
 I stretched and planted a light kiss on Tonino's cheek.
 v07to0241
 トニー「No, don't use words, tell me with your body.」
 After seemingly giving up, Tonino slowly reached his hand for my breast.
 black450
 ev053g
 v06si0202
 シルヴ「Nn...」
 As my breast was fondled, I continued stimulating his shaft.
  Though using my mouth would be much faster, there's no way I'm gonna do that kind of thing.
 At this kind of time, it's much better to keep teasing and teasing him just like this... he definitely won't be able to endure it.
 
 I was treating this like a game, wondering when he would start begging.
 ev053e
 v06si0203
 シルヴ「Could you... massage a little more gently?」
 I ordered him.
 v07to0242
 トニー「...Then, could you use your mouth?」
 v06si0204
 シルヴ「Don't reply to a question with a question, idiot!」
 I aimed a poke at his forehead.
  There's no way I'm gonna do that so easily!
 black450
 ev053m
 With that in mind, I wrapped my fingers around his excited shaft, and continued slowly massaging it.
 While playing with the most sensitive part, the tip... when I noticed him reacting, I immediately stopped.
 Then, after waiting for a while until he cooled down, I resumed stroking up and down again.
 v07to0243
 トニー「...You're doing that on purpose!」
 He grabbed my waist, and his face grew sullen as he said that.
 ev053p
 v06si0205
 シルヴ「Man, you're really acting like a kid.」
 I giggled.
 v07to0244
 トニー「Tch... fine, whatever. I'm just a kid anyway...」
 Giving up, Tonino lay down with his arms and legs spread wide.
 ev053o
 v06si0206
 シルヴ「Fufu... it's good that you understand.」
 I concentrated on stroking Tonino. This time, I'm not just gonna stop halfway.
 
 ev053m
 v06si0207
 シルヴ
 「（―Maybe this is enough tonight?
 Since we have to wake up early tomorrow...）」
 As I thought of that, I increased the speed of my hand movements.
 v07to0245
 トニー「Wait... Syl... via.」
 Suddenly, Tonino's body became stiff in an instant.
 v06si0208
 シルヴ「How is it?
 Does it feel good?」
 With as much skin contact as I'd had with him in the past, there's no way I wouldn't know his sensitive spots.
 
 v06si0209
 シルヴ「...Come on, just let it out quickly.」
 v07to0246
 トニー「N-no way...」
 He was most sensitive at the lower part of his shaft.
 ev053p
 v06si0210
 シルヴ「It's okay, you can make a little noise. I love it... when a boy moans.」
 v07to0247
 トニー「D-damn you...」
 That's why, I was pressing that part with my palm, while stroking―
 v07to0248
 トニー「...Hey, I-I can't stand it any longer...」
 ev053o
 v06si0211
 シルヴ「Atta boy, good of you to be honest...」

 v06si0741
 シルヴ「Kyah!」
 v06si0742
 シルヴ「W-what kind of idiot does that all of a sudden?!」
 v07to0505
 トニー「...I held it back as long as I could.」
 ev053r
 v06si0743
 シルヴ「...Man, clean it up yourself...」
 v07to0506
 トニー「...Silvia, I'm not gonna let you run away tonight, you know?」
 He murmured, then suddenly got up.
 black450
 v06si0212
 シルヴ「W-what are you doing?」
 v07to0249
 トニー「...What else! Don't treat people like kids!」
 v06si0213
 シルヴ「Eh...?」
 As he said that, Tonino forced me down on the bed.
 ev054b
 v06si0214
 シルヴ「W-wait, Tonino...」
 v07to0251
 トニー「It's been so long. Now, I wonder if this body you've forgotten for so long can still make you feel good?」
 Full of excitement, I stripped off Silvia's jeans and underwear, and had my fill of groping her butt.
 v07to0252
 トニー「(―It's been so long since I felt this sensation, too...)」
 Just by thinkin that, I regained my erection again.
  Even so, Silvia's eyebrows creased... she turned her head, looked at me,
 v06si0215
 シルヴ「Hey, Tonino. Shouldn't we stop here after all?」
 and asked me that all of a sudden.
 v07to0253
 トニー「Why?
 You're the one who invited me, you know.」
 v06si0216
 シルヴ「But... the play is the day after tomorrow, right?」
 v07to0254
 トニー「That's why we have to do it now while we can.」
 My preparation was complete, and all I had to do was stick it in.
 
 
 v07to0255
 トニー「Also, if we stop now... who knows when we might have another chance.」
 ev054d
 v06si0217
 シルヴ「Hmph. You're pretty greedy.」
 She sighed, seeming like she had given up.
 v06si0218
 シルヴ「Oh well, fine. ...So, are we gonna do it like this?」
 v07to0256
 トニー「Well, if you leave it up to me.」
 But, since the position made her use her arms to support herself, she complained.
 ev054b
 v06si0219
 シルヴ「...This position is tough on my arms.」
 v07to0257
 トニー「Is it because of your weight?」
 v06si0220
 シルヴ「Idiot, do you wanna die?」
 She said as she narrowed her eyes and glared at me... seems like she's seriously getting angry.
 v07to0257_a
 トニー「...Well, if you're the one who killed me, I'd be satisfied.」
 I joked while offering my neck to her mouth.
 v06si0222
 シルヴ「Hmph!
 Tonino, you dummy!」
 All of a sudden, Silvia nipped my neck with her canines.
 v07to0258
 トニー「Ououououch!」
 v06si0223
 シルヴ「...Hmph, wasn't that just a love bite?」
 v07to0259
 トニー「Uwah, I'm bleeding...」
 I clutched my neck dramatically, and acted as if I was going to faint.
 v06si0224
 シルヴ「N-no way!?
 Are you alright, Tonino?
 I didn't meant to do that...」
 v07to0260
 トニー「I'm kidding.」
 I laughed all of a sudden, but it seemed like she doesn't think it was funny,
 v06si0225
 シルヴ「Idiot!」
 and raised her leg kicking mine.
 v07to0261
 トニー「Ouuuucch!」
 If she had kicked my shin, I would have really been hurting.
 v06si0226
 シルヴ「Hmph!
 You must be acting, anyway.」
 v07to0262
 トニー「...Yeah, but I'm not gonna be acting from now on.」
 When I have such a delicious dish in front of me for the first time in a while, I mustn't let it go to waste by fooling around. 
 I must savor this to the fullest.
 With that in mind, I reached my hands for her buxom breasts.
 ev054c
 v06si0227
 シルヴ「Ah...」
 v07to0263
 トニー「You're still sensitive as usual.」
 That sweet moan in addition to her reaction, instantly made me hard again.
 v07to0264
 トニー「Here, too...」
 I reached my other hand to the lower part of her body.
 ev054b
 v06si0228
 シルヴ「...Ah, no...」
 Even though I haven't touched her there yet, she was already drenched, transparent liquid flowing down her leg.
 v07to0265
 トニー「Oi oi, could you not get so horny before I even do anything?」
 v06si0229
 シルヴ「...O-of course I'm not!
 I was waiting for you.」
 As she said that, Silvia lifted her butt, and lightly shook it.
 v07to0266
 トニー「...I see, well, sorry.」
 I reached my hand for her breast.
 ev054a
 v06si0230
 シルヴ「Aa... nn.」
 Her back suddenly arched as I did that. Pleased by her reaction, I slowly guided my shaft inside the crevice between her thighs.
 
 black450
 ev054e
 v07to0267
 トニー「Fu, haa, haa...!」
 The sensation of tightness as I moved inside her felt so good it made me grow even bigger.
 v07to0268
 トニー「This is great, Silvia...!
 You're still so tight as usual.」
 ev054f
 v06si0231
 シルヴ「I-idiot!
 Don't say... nn, something weird like... that!」
 She retorted with a red face, though that's one of the cute things about her.
 
 v07to0269
 トニー「It's okay for you to make a little noise, you know. It's not like I mind that.」
 I smacked my hips against hers intensely, and as she felt that, she reacted by gripping her hands tightly.
 ev054g
 v06si0232
 シルヴ「Ah, haa, haa, aa, ngh!」
 Her voice, as if she was trying to endure herself, really tickled my carnal instincts.
 It felt really good fondling her breast as it shook with the rhythm of me moving my hips.
 v07to0270
 トニー「By the way... about the ring earlier.」
 ev054f
 v06si0233
 シルヴ「Eh!?」
 Those words made her body stiffen up in an instant.
 v07to0271
 トニー「Oucch!
 Relax, Silvia!」
 ev054g
 v06si0234
 シルヴ「Ah, s-sorry...」
 She exhaled heavily, and adjusted the tightness of her insides to an optimum level. As I moved my hips, I continued talking.
 
 
 v07to0272
 トニー「It's really great that you were able to find it.」
 I looked at my own ring finger, and couldn't help but laugh.
 Even I thought how out of character it was for me to consider something like matching rings.
 ev054f
 v06si0235
 シルヴ「...Y-yeah...」
 v07to0273
 トニー「Where did you find it?」
 v06si0236
 シルヴ「That's, not... really, important, right...?」
 Why are you getting shy all of a sudden?
 v07to0274
 トニー「(...Oh well, whatever. Rather than that, now is more important...)」
 She's a really whimsical person, so who knows when she'll get into the mood again like this.
 ev054e
 v07to0275
 トニー「Haa, haa, haa...」
 v06si0237
 シルヴ「Ah, haa, haa...... this feels... good...」
 Silvia arched her back, and following that movement, her insides grew tighter.
 
 v07to0276
 トニー「It's been a while... since we've done this... I'm getting a little...」
 ev054f

 v06si0239
 シルヴ「Nn... aah...」
 We both knew that we were almost at our limit.
 v07to0278
 トニー「...Sorry... but I might be a little early.」
 I pressed firmly against her round, pale bottom.

 Silvia clutched the bedsheet, and closed her eyes.
 ev054e
 v06si0242
 シルヴ「Ah, ah, ah, aah, ngh, ngh, nggh!」
 As her body trembled and shook, it only stimulated me further.

 After I came into the room Wakaba was lodging in, we sat on the bed, facing each other... unable to calm down within such a close distance to each other, we were at a loss how to break this awkward atmosphere.
 
 
 At times like this I suppose I, being the man, should take the initiative by suggesting ‘can I kiss you?’, right?
 
 As I shifted my vision to the corner of the room, thinking about that, I heard the sound of clothes brushing against each other beside me.
 
 ev048a
 And when I turned my head to look back at her, attracted by that noise―
 
 
 v03wa2997
 ワカバ「Don't stare so much...」
 She was there, but without me noticing, she'd taken off her skirt.
 Those white thighs of hers took my vision hostage.
 v04ce1055a
 セロ「Uh, um...」
  I had no idea what to say.
 v03wa2998
 ワカバ「...Cero. You... didn't want to?」
 She said with an uneasy voice as she embraced me, dazed with confusion.
 What was she referring to? Being with her? Or the kiss? Or... the thing that I imagined we're about to do? I couldn't tell.
 
 But, whichever it was... I'm not going to refuse her.
 v04ce1056
 セロ「O-of course not!」
 I hugged Wakaba tightly, and our bodies pressed together... that was the answer to all of our questions. 
 
 ev048c
 v03wa2999
 ワカバ「Ah...nn!」
 Wakaba closed her eyes and let out a pleasant voice.
 The sensation of her smooth skin made my body heat up.

 セロ「(―Aah, I guess things are going to get awkward in this position...)」
 I was getting an erection... though I tried to think of something to deal with that, but in the end I couldn't stop it.
 
 The sensation of her skin through my hands made her seem so small and fragile within my arms as I embraced her.
 
 Within my arms wrapped around her, I felt the trembling of her body ease, and she felt more like a girl than ever before.

 ワカバ「C-Cero...?」
  Wakaba looked up to me with a reddened face.
 v03wa3001
 ワカバ「...What are you thinking right now?」
 For a moment, her sudden question put me at a loss for words.
 v04ce1058
 セロ「Nothing really... I just had the feeling you're more of a girl than I expected.」
 v03wa3002
 ワカバ「...So you've never really seen me as a girl before, I see.」
 v04ce1059
 セロ「That's not what I mean. I meant that looking at you right now makes me feel that you're more of a girl.」
 To prove that I wasn't lying, I hugged her tighter.
 v03wa3003
 ワカバ「...Cero...」
 v04ce1060
 セロ「It's because it's here and now that I must tell you...」
 I buried my face in Wakaba's neck.
  My nose was filled with the fluffy, sweet smell of her girlishness... and then,
 v04ce1061
 セロ「I love you,」
  I confessed to her.
 ev048c
 v03wa3004
 ワカバ「...W-what's with you, saying that... all of a sudden...」
 I could feel from my contact with her skin that her body was slowly growing warmer...
 v04ce1062
 セロ「You didn't hear it?
 Should I say it once more?」
 v03wa3005
 ワカバ「O-okay.」
 v04ce1063
 セロ「...I love you, Wakaba.」
 ev048d
 v03wa3006
 ワカバ「...E-ehehe... somehow I feel embarrassed...」
 v04ce1064
 セロ「Do you want me to say it one more time?」
 v03wa3007
 ワカバ「I want to say, as many times as you can... but if I hear it too often, it might start feeling insincere.」
 v04ce1065
 セロ「Then, what should I do?」
 Faced with my question, Wakaba silently hugged me tight as her answer.
  I could feel her fingers drawing circles upon my shoulders in a rhythm.
 ev048b
 v03wa3008
 ワカバ「...I-I don't know. I'm really nervous... my mind is about to go blank.」
 Wakaba bit her lip, and her face drew close to my cheek.

 ev048e
 v03wa3009
 ワカバ「Even though this should be enough... but somehow I still feel not satisfied.」
 She moved her body around restlessly... is that a body language explaining what she can't say in words?
 v04ce1066
 セロ「(―So, Wakaba... wants to do it too?)」
 ...Am I going too far by thinking that on my own accord?
 No. Even if I'm mistaken, this is the time when I must take the initiative. I mustn't let Wakaba wait any longer.
 
 v04ce1067
 セロ「...Hey, Wakaba. This is hard for me to say, but...」
 v03wa3010
 ワカバ「......Hm?」
 v04ce1068
 セロ「I... I want to do it, with you...」
 v03wa3011
 ワカバ「......」
 v04ce1069
 セロ「B-but!
 If you don't want to...」
 v03wa3012
 ワカバ「...How could I not?」
 She leaned her head beside mine, her breath warm against my ears.

 v03wa3013
 ワカバ「―I do. If it's you, Cero... I want to.」
 v04ce1070
 セロ「T-thank you.」

 v03wa3014
 ワカバ「...Dummy. This isn't the time to be thanking anyone.」
 v04ce1071
 セロ「Sorry.」
 ev048e
 v03wa3015
 ワカバ「...Oh man!
 Don't start apologizing either... okay?」
 As Wakaba scolded me, I paid more attention to what I was saying, and softly stroked her hair.
 v03wa3016
 ワカバ「...Nn...」
 It was adorable the way she let out such a soft, sweet sigh.
 v04ce1072
 セロ「Wakaba...」
 From their place encircling Wakaba's back, my arms moved.
 ev048f
 v03wa3017
 ワカバ「Ah... nn.」
 Wakaba's upper body arched forward, and the sensation of her thighs pressing against me was like an electric shock―
 
 ev048e
 v03wa3018
 ワカバ「Ah... Cero, you're getting hard, aren't you?」
 As she said that, I replied naturally.
 v04ce1073
 セロ「...Is that a problem?」
 v03wa3019
 ワカバ「Of course not. Even I...」
 v04ce1074
 セロ「You feel it too, Wakaba?」
 I pressed my lower body to hers. Growing restless from my sudden actions, she clung to me as if she were afraid to lose me.
 v03wa3020
 ワカバ「Doing that all of a sudden, that's mean...」
 Murmuring that, she clamped me tighly between her thighs. In turn, I lifted her up by her back, and rubbed my lower body against her.
 
 ev048f
 v03wa3021
 ワカバ「Ha, ah... ha, aah...!」
 Though Wakaba's skin and voice were both soft, I was only getting harder.
 v03wa3022
 ワカバ「...C-Cero... y-you're getting so hard...?」
 v04ce1075
 セロ「...Y-yeah. Wakaba... are you feeling good too?」
 v03wa3023
 ワカバ「Y-you know even if I don't say it, right?」
 Wakaba closed her eyes quietly, and gently nipped at my shoulders.
 v04ce1076
 セロ「Can I touch your breasts, Wakaba?」
 ev048e
 v03wa3024
 ワカバ「We've already come to this... you... can do anything.」 
 I let our bodies part slightly, and slowly reached my hand out to her small breasts. Her nipples were hard as my fingertips touched them, and around them―
 
 v04ce1077
 セロ「...So soft.」
 ev048f
 v03wa3025
 ワカバ「Geez, what are you saying... nn...」
 v04ce1078
 セロ「...But that's my honest thought.」
 v03wa3026
 ワカバ「Forget it!
 You don't need to say something like that!」

 Suddenly, my lips were silenced by hers.
 black450
 v03wa3027
 ワカバ「...Nn...」
 v04ce1079
 セロ「Ah, Waka... Ba...」
 I tried not to lose my balance, but her strength was greater then I had expected, and I couldn't stay upright.
 ev048c
 v03wa3028
 ワカバ「Kya!」
 We both fall upon the bed, our bodies separated.
 black450
 v03wa3029
 ワカバ「...Ufufu.」
 v04ce1080
 セロ「Ahaha...」
 Our passion had not cooled down when we were separated... it's just that we'd gotten so heated up we couldn't tell what had happened.
 
 v04ce1081
 セロ「Wakaba... can I?」
 v03wa3030
 ワカバ「...Sure.」
 Without any further words, we started kissing each other once more, and slowly shifted positions.
 ev049s
 v03wa3031
 ワカバ「...Ah, no...」
 After taking off her underwear, Wakaba shut her eyes tight.
 v03wa3032
 ワカバ「D-don't look...」
  she said in a small voice.
 v04ce1082
 セロ「But, if I don't see, I can't do it right, can I?」
 ev049t
 v03wa3033
 ワカバ「Y, you're right, but...」
 She tried to close her legs as if she'd changed her mind, but I gently held them apart, and looked between them.
 v04ce1083
 セロ「...You're wet.」
 ev049r
 v03wa3034
 ワカバ「...Ah, no...」
 My face drew closer to Wakaba's lower body, and I warmed it with my breath.
 ev049u
 v03wa3035
 ワカバ「Ah... haa, haa, nn.」
 Her eyes still shut tight, she grabbed a pillow beside her, as I slowly reached for Wakaba's secret spot with my fingers―
 
 ev049s
 v03wa3036
 ワカバ「Ah...!」
 I silently savored her reaction.
 v04ce1084
 セロ「...Wakaba, try to relax more.」
 I slowly traced my fingers upon her small cleft.
 black450
 ev049a
 v03wa3037
 ワカバ「Haa, haa, haa... a-are you touching it?」
 v04ce1085
 セロ「That's right. You're really hot here, Wakaba...」
 I slowly slid my finger along her pubic mound, and inside her sensitive valley.
 ev049b
 v03wa3038
 ワカバ「Au...uuu!
 Haa, aa...」
 Wakaba's legs suddenly jerked as if they were cramped.
 v04ce1086
 セロ「...Does it hurt?」
 ev049c
 v03wa3039
 ワカバ「N-no. I-it doesn't hurt. ...I-it feels... great.」
 She said, stammering slowly, as if just talking required tremendous effort from her.
 v03wa3040
 ワカバ「I-it'll be fine... after a while, so don't worry...」
 v04ce1087
 セロ「...Okay.」
 My finger slowly ventured further into the depths of the bush before me.
 ev049h
 v03wa3041
 ワカバ「...Haa, aaaah!」
 As she shuddered once, her nails sank into the pillow she was holding.
 As I watched her reaction, I slowly moved my fingers in her.
 Just by doing that, hot liquid was flowing out from her insides already.
 v04ce1088
 セロ「Wakaba...」
 I drew closer to Wakaba's wet lower body, kissed her, and then softly began sucking.
 
 I slowly licked the juices of her love flowing down her body, savoring their slightly sweet taste.
 ev049k
 v03wa3042
 ワカバ「Fuuaaaaaa, au, uuuuu, C-Cero... I-if you do it like, that!」
 As Wakaba's body tensed up, she clamped my fingertips inside her. 
 v04ce1089
 セロ「...Wakaba, try to relax.」
 ev049j
 v03wa3043
 ワカバ「I-I'm trying... I'm trying to relax, but...」
 v04ce1090
 セロ「...There, there...」
 I raised up my face, patted her head, and gave a kiss to her forehead.
 
 ev049g
 v03wa3044
 ワカバ「...Thank you.」
 Her legs relaxed, and my fingers were set free.
 Just like that, as Wakaba's body slowly covered mine―
 v04ce1091
 セロ「Sorry, I don't think I'm very good at this...」
  I apologized to her.
 v03wa3045
 ワカバ「...If it's you, Cero... I don't mind.」
 Wakaba reached her arm down to me gently, and guided my shaft to her entrance.
 And then, after fixing our positions, she shut her eyes tight as if in resolution.
 ev049h
 v03wa3046
 ワカバ「...I'm ready, Cero...」
 she said, permitting me to enter her.
 v04ce1092
 セロ「...I'm going to do it.」
 I first stimulated her sensitive clitoris with my tip, and using the juices that flowed out of her as a lubricant, I penetrated her insides with all my might.

 v03wa3047
 ワカバ「...Nnnn!」
 v04ce1093
 セロ「D-does it hurt?」
 v03wa3048
 ワカバ「...I'm fine... so...」
 Her body trembled, she arched her back, and she kept on shaking her head left and right.
 Watching Wakaba's pained reaction, I eased my strength, and moved my hips much more slowly.
 
 ev049k
 v03wa3049
 ワカバ「...C-Cero... i-it's okay. Y-you... d-don't, have to...」
 v04ce1094

 v03wa3050
 ワカバ「...I'm yours, so... aaah, please, do as you wish...」
 v04ce1095
 セロ「...Wakaba...」
 The speaking of her name, the countless kisses I'd given her.
 Among these immeasurable sensations, our tongues entwined, drowning in pleasure, forgetting anything and everything.
 
 ev049l
 v03wa3051
 ワカバ「Nn, haa, haa, au...!」
 I hugged Wakaba's waist towards me while her hands pressed against mine, pulling out, then repeating. My movements were much quicker than earlier as I stirred up the inside of her body.
 
 v03wa3052
 ワカバ「N, kuu, fuu, fuaa...!」
 On top, our faces were moist from kissing each other―
 ev049k
 v03wa3053
 ワカバ「Aaah... C-Cero...」
 while at the bottom, we were joining with each other.
 v04ce1096
 セロ「...Wakaba, I love you...」
 v03wa3054
 ワカバ「I, I... love you too...!」
 The confessions leaking from between our lips increased the temperature of our lower bodies.
 ev049l
 v03wa3055
 ワカバ「Fu, fuaa... My, my head feels, so, blank...」
 As Wakaba clung atop me, I said nothing, and continued moving my hips.
 v03wa3056
 ワカバ「...I-I can't think about anything anymore... I can, only feel...」
 v04ce1097
 セロ「Uh, um... it's okay, you don't have to think of anything.」
 ev049k
 v03wa3057
 ワカバ「B-but... I know... about yours. I can feel, how big it is...」
 v03wa3058
 ワカバ「We're, now, c-connected... as one... right?」
 v04ce1098
 セロ「T-that's right.」
 Wakaba's body started trembling.
 I traced my fingers in a line from her breast to her ribs, and she didn't suppress her reaction at all.
 ev049j
 v03wa3059
 ワカバ「Ah, aaah...」
 v04ce1099
 セロ「...W-Wakaba... you're so cute...」
 v03wa3060
 ワカバ「Ah, haa, haa... haa, ngh, ku... nn!」
 She shut her eyes tight, and her lower body tightened up.
 That sensation made my limit approach more closely―
 ev049k
 v03wa3061
 ワカバ「I-it's... okay, Cero. You don't, have to hold back...」
 v04ce1100
 セロ「B-but...」

 ワカバ「In, return... please... fill me... up... fully.」
 v04ce1101
 セロ「...Wakaba...!」
 v03wa3063
 ワカバ「Please fill me up... Cero...」
 Those words of hers made my rationality fly out the window.
 v04ce1102
 セロ「W-Wakaba... I-I'm about to...」
 v03wa3064
 ワカバ「Y-yeah... you can...」
 I pulled her to me with all my might, and slammed my hips against hers.
 
 v04ce1103
 セロ「Ngh...!」

 v03wa3065
 ワカバ「Ah, aaaaaaa...!」

 v04ce1104
 セロ「Haa... haa.」
 Just as she had asked, I shot all of my load inside her.
 ev049q
 v03wa3066
 ワカバ「Ah...」
 And then, exhausted, Wakaba slowly looked up at me.
 v03wa3067
 ワカバ「I can feel it, Cero's hot thing... inside me.」
 Wakaba said, smiling.
  Just like that, I fell on top of her, and indulged myself in the feeling of her in my arms...
 black450
 v03wa3073
 ワカバ「...H-hey... Cero...」
 v04ce1109
 セロ「...What is it?」
 Profound fatigue was overcoming me as I lay down on the bed, my body still feverish.
 v03wa3074
 ワカバ「The bed sheet is all messed up... I wonder if that's a problem?」
 v04ce1110
 セロ「...Ah, aah...」
 This was not a hotel, but a room borrowed from the kind people of this city.
  Rather than worrying about the wrinkles in the sheets, don't you think there are more important concerns!?
 v04ce1111
 セロ「...W-Wakaba...」
 v03wa3075
 ワカバ「...Zzzz...」
 v04ce1112
 セロ「Ugh, she's already asleep...」
 I tried to think of something even as my head spun―
 v04ce1113
 セロ「(―We both got into a fight, I was slapped, and I got a nosebleed.)」
 I wonder if an excuse like that would work when the time comes?

  And then, he lifted my shirt... and gently kissed my breast.

 ワカバ「Hyaah!」
 v04ce1114

 He asked me as he looked up, but I shook my head.

 v03wa1078
 ワカバ「I'm not cold.」
 I answered honestly.
 v04ce1115
 セロ「Then that's good.」
 ev050e
 Cero nodded, and buried his face in my cleavage.
 v03wa1079
 ワカバ「No... Ah, aah.」
 My breasts aren't really that big... and if he touches them like that, he'll realize... this is embarrassing.
 
 ev050f
 v04ce1116
 セロ「...Wakaba, I love you.」
 After saying that, he immediately started kissing my breasts once again.
  And then, he cupped my small breast in his right hand.
 ev050j
 v03wa1080
 ワカバ「Ah... uu.」
 This is so embarrassing, does he think my breasts are too small...?
 ev050g
 v04ce1117
 セロ「What's wrong, Wakaba?」
 Cero turned his gaze to the expression on my face, and when our eyes met, my face grew redder than before.
 
 ev050h
 v03wa1081
 ワカバ「T-that's because... my breasts are small... and you're looking at them.」
 ev050j
 v04ce1118
 セロ「...Wakaba.」
 He buried his face between my breasts once more, and kissed me there.
 ev050g
 v04ce1119
 セロ「You don't need to worry about that. After all, Wakaba, you didn't choose to have breasts like these.」
 Cero said with a chuckle, embarrassing me further.
 v03wa1082
 ワカバ「But that's because... I don't have any confidence in them.」
 v04ce1120
 セロ「...Well, I like small breasts.」
 Those were kind words... but are they true?
 v03wa1083
 ワカバ「Then, what if they grow larger someday?」
 ev050g
 v04ce1121
 セロ「...Then I'll start to like big ones.」
 ev050h
 v03wa1084
 ワカバ「You dummy, you dummy!
 You just said that you like small ones!」
 v04ce1122
 セロ「I wouldn't mind you with big breasts either... since they're yours, that's why I like them.」
 ev050g
 v03wa1085
 ワカバ「...Cero...」
 v04ce1123
 セロ「Didn't I say that just now?」
 I could find no words to answer him.
 Even though now I don't have to worry he'll reject me because of my breast size, I've been worried about this for a long time. If he accepts me as I am this easily, I'll feel troubled―
 
 ev050e
 v04ce1124
 セロ「...I've made you feel lonely all this while, right?」
 Cero's sudden murmur pulled me back to reality.
 v04ce1125
 セロ「―I never realized how you felt... sorry.」
 ev050c
 v03wa1086
 ワカバ「Eh, ah, I...」
 ev050e
 v04ce1126
 セロ「I guess this is thanks to that note.」
 v04ce1127
 セロ「―The note you wrote that appeared in my hands by sheer luck.」
 ev050f
 v04ce1128
 セロ「...If that weren't the case, I would never had known how you felt about me...」
 ev050d
 v03wa1087
 ワカバ「...It's fine...」
 Cero wasn't lying. I could tell that just by listening to his voice.
 
 What a relief... that the note hadn't been lost, and had found its way to Cero.
  Ah, since if it weren't for that, Cero wouldn't have confessed to me like this, I guess?

 Cero's hands increased in intensity and speed as they caressed my breast.

 v03wa1088
 ワカバ「AH, ah... haa, C-Cero...!」
 It was becoming difficult to breathe.
  Me, and Cero... are doing something like this.
 I had never thought that this would happen... but I don't mind it at all. I'm happy.
 
 ev050h
 v03wa1089
 ワカバ「Ahn, haa, haa... haa, haaa...」
 Unable to hold myself back, I let out a cry that even I could not believe was mine.
 Cero pinched my nipples with his fingers, and toyed with them, gently moving them up and down.
 v04ce1130
 セロ「...A-are you okay?」
 That gentle movement caused an indescribable feeling to flow through my spine.
 This wasn't a shiver from the cold.
 v03wa1090
 ワカバ「This feels... good.」
 I stroked Cero's hair.
 ev050k
 v04ce1131
 セロ「Really? Then that's good.」
 
 As he said that, Cero continued kissing my breast, and used his tongue to lick around my nipples.
 All the while stimulating my breast by caressing it with his hands...
 v03wa1091
 ワカバ「Haa, haa, haa... ahn.」
 My head was gradually turning blank, and I could already barely tell what was happening.
 v03wa1092
 ワカバ「...Cero, Cero, Cero!」
 Other than calling out his name as my body trembled, there was nothing else I could do.
 v04ce1132
 セロ「...Wakaba, stay still.」
 v03wa1093
 ワカバ「Eh...?」
 Unconsciously, my lower body had begun clinging tightly to Cero.
 ev050c
 v03wa1094
 ワカバ「C-Cero!」
 ev050e
 v04ce1133

 He laughed softly as he said something he normally wouldn't say.

 v03wa1095
 ワカバ「No... don't say something like that out loud...」
 ev050e
 v04ce1134
 セロ「It means you feel good, right?
 Then I think it's fine.」
 He placed his finger on the surface of my underwear, and gently moved his finger up and down along in a line.
 ev050c
 v03wa1096
 ワカバ「...Nn!」
 My back suddenly arched backwards.
  Even though he had touched it so gently... no, the reason why I was feeling this way was because he's touching me this gently.
 v03wa1097
 ワカバ「...T-this feels... good.」
 I was so embarrassed I wanted him to stop, yet, I was unable to resist. The two feelings conflicted in my mind, I tightly hugged Cero... as he pressed closer to me in turn.
 
 v03wa1098
 ワカバ「Cero, Cero...」
 With no idea what more to do, I kept calling out his name repeatedly.
 His right hand, which had already slid below my waist, was slowly exploring the surface of my panties and kept stimulating me as he drew circles with his fingers.

 ワカバ「Ah... s-stop...」
 v04ce1135

 ワカバ「...Not... really...」
 The increasing pleasure made me breathe heavily.
 v04ce1136
 セロ「...Wakaba, you're getting so wet...」
 Cero said, his expression one of a mild surprise... It looked to me as if he was displeased.
 v03wa1101
 ワカバ「That's, that's because, because...」
 v04ce1137
 セロ「It's okay, Wakaba.」
 He suddenly took my hands, and guided them to his lower body.
 v04ce1138
 セロ「...Do you understand now?」
 For a moment, I didn't know what he meant, and almost asked ‘what?’, but then I realized―
 black450
 ev050g
 v03wa1102
 ワカバ「(―He's... so warm too...)」
 I could tell from the throbbing pulse that his feelings were gathered there... which left me at a loss for words.

 v03wa1103
 ワカバ「...Yeah.」
 He gave me a gentle smile, and then took me into his arms.

 v04ce1142
 セロ「No, you too, Wakaba. ...Since, I've been in love with you for such a long time... and you never noticed, right?」
 v03wa1106
 ワカバ「...Eh, is... is that so?」
 v04ce1143
 セロ「Yup.」
 I felt a little dissatisfied that he agreed so easily.
  So that meant, Cero had been always thinking about me, since a long time ago... right?
 v04ce1144
 セロ「Sorry. I didn't intend to blame you.」

 v03wa1107

 Even though I felt a little hurt by his words, that wasn't important. Since this day that I had waited for so long had finally come.
 v03wa1108
 ワカバ「...But, now that I know that... I'm not gonna ever let you go.」
 v04ce1145

 We embraced each other, and glanced around us.
 Above the wagon we'd decided to camp in was the sky, full of stars... is this what you call romantic?

 ワカバ「...Thank you, Cero.」
 I gave him a light kiss on the cheek, and this time, I reached out for his crotch by myself.
 v03wa1110
 ワカバ「Even though doing this is a little embarrassing, please... accept this as my thanks.」
 Actually, I wasn't normally this bold.
 But, if it would make Cero happy... then I thought becoming a bit more bold was for the better.
 
 ev051a
 v03wa1111
 ワカバ「Nn...」
 Wakaba was kissing my shaft.
 v04ce1146
 セロ「I-it's fine even if you don't do something like this...」
 Feeling embarrassed, I said something like that.
 v03wa1112
 ワカバ「...You don't want it?」
 She asked, her eyes gazing up at me, making me hesitate in responding.
 v04ce1147
 セロ「I-it's not that I don't want it... i-it's just I'm not prepared... for something like this.」
 v03wa1113
 ワカバ「...Cero, I'll pay you back for everything you've done for me up until now.」
 As she said that, she kissed my shaft.
 v03wa1114
 ワカバ「All my thanks, all my apologies... is it not enough?」
 v04ce1148
 セロ「I-it's not... that it's not enough...」
 Rather, I should say that I was happy. But... how did we end up in this situation?
 
 This is the wrong way around. I should be the one who's giving thanks, not Wakaba―
 ev051b
 v03wa1115
 ワカバ「Nn... mm... Cero... you're so big.」
 Her lips quietly took my thing into her mouth, and the gentle sensation of her tongue sent waves of pleasure directly to my brain.
 
 v04ce1149
 セロ「(―Aaah...)」
 v03wa1116
 ワカバ「Mmh... ah, you're... getting bigger again?」
 She murmured while stimulating me as if she were licking ice cream.
 v04ce1150
 セロ「S-stop...」
 Since this was my first time, the sensation was far more than I had expected, and I'd gotten excited. Honestly, even though I'd asked her to stop, in truth, I was happy.
 
 She was showing me a face I'd never seen before, a face as if she were in a trance...
 
 v04ce1151
 セロ「Nn...」
 Without realizing it, I'd let out a moan, this is embarrassing...
 ev051a
 v03wa1117
 ワカバ「...Ah, does it hurt?」
 Wakaba looked up to me with a puzzled expression.
 v04ce1152
 セロ「...No, it feels really good...」
 I said, while stroking her head.
 v04ce1153
 セロ「It's just that it's a little embarrassing...」
 I told her honestly how I was feeling when our eyes met. Hearing that, Wakaba laughed.
 v03wa1118
 ワカバ「...Dummy.」
 v04ce1154
 セロ「Well, maybe I am a dummy.」
 I imitated Wakaba's mannerism by knocking my own head, and sighed.
 v03wa1119
 ワカバ「If you say it like that, even I would... get embarrassed, you know?」
 she said, her eyes looking up at me from below.
 v03wa1120
 ワカバ「―If you don't like it, then I guess I'll stop...」
 she murmured with a lonely tone.
 v04ce1155
 セロ「...N-no, that's not what I meant!
 It's because... you're too cute, Wakaba...」
 
 v03wa1121
 ワカバ「...E-ehehe. Thank you, I'll... do my best.」
 She said, continuing to grin as she started stimulating the tip of my shaft with her left hand.
 Soon, with the movements of her lips and the licking of her tongue, I gradually grew moist myself.
 ev051k
 v03wa1122
 ワカバ「...Cero... h-how is it...?」
 v04ce1156
 セロ「...Y-yeah. I-it feels really, good...」
 ev051l
 v03wa1123
 ワカバ「I see... that's good...」
 We were breathing heavily due to the vigorous activity. I couldn't stop myself from reaching out for Wakaba's small breast.
 
 v03wa1124
 ワカバ「...Ahn!」
 I felt as if they were larger than earlier.
 v04ce1157
 セロ「So soft...」
 Driven by my lust, I started caressing Wakaba's breasts.
 ev051m
 v03wa1125
 ワカバ「Hauu...!」
 Wakaba closed her eyes, stopped moving her mouth, and her body started trembling.
 v03wa1126
 ワカバ「Stop... not my breasts...」
 Wakaba let out a lovely voice as the pressure of my hand increased. This mutual stimulation made me all the more excited.
 
 ev051k
 v03wa1127
 ワカバ「If you touch it so much... like that... my hands and mouth can't do what I'm doing.」
 v04ce1158
 セロ「...I don't mind.」
 ev051m
 v03wa1128
 ワカバ「Mmmh... O-oh, Cero... you...」
 Though I still wanted her to continue, I didn't stop caressing her. Wakaba, on the other hand, was still trying desperately to pleasure me.
 I couldn't help but laugh at her cute behavior.
 ev051k
 v03wa1129
 ワカバ「...Y-you don't have to laugh, right?」
 v04ce1159
 セロ「―Well, that's because your reaction is too cute...」
 v03wa1130
 ワカバ「Saying that kind of thing again... mmh, stop, stop it.」
 v04ce1160
 セロ「Why?」
 ev051m
 v03wa1131
 ワカバ「B-because... I'm trying really hard for your sake right... now... aah...」
 v04ce1161
 セロ「It's okay. We could both enjoy ourselves together like this... right?」
 v03wa1132
 ワカバ「B-but... if you do that... I, I... I'll...」
 v04ce1162
 セロ「...Hm?」
 Since I couldn't hear what she was saying, I leaned down and waited for her to say it again.
 ev051l
 v03wa1133
 ワカバ「...I'll... feel like I want to do it... right?」
 v04ce1163
 セロ「...Eh?
 Do what?」
 ev051k
 v03wa1134
 ワカバ「Geez!
 Don't ask me again!
 You should know when I say it like that...」
 After looking at her hips squirming as if in frustration, I understood what she meant.
 v04ce1164
 セロ「Ah... s-so that's what you meant.」
 v03wa1135
 ワカバ「...Dummy... this is really embarrassing, you know.」
 v04ce1165

 v03wa1136
 ワカバ「No! I'm still doing it to you, aren't I?」
 Wakaba ordered, twisted away from me, then attacked me more strongly and swiftly than before.
 
 v04ce1166
 セロ「Uua... W-Waka... Ba...」
 v03wa1137
 ワカバ「...Man, stop pushing me around. I wanna see... what face you make...」
 v04ce1167
 セロ「T-then, at least let me fondle you over there...」
 v03wa1138
 ワカバ「It's fine, it's my turn now. ...Answer me, does it feel good?」
 v04ce1168
 セロ「...Yeah...」
 v03wa1139
 ワカバ「How good...?」
 v04ce1169
 セロ「...Uuu... t-that's... aah...」
 Wakaba kept switching her hands one after the other to stimulate my shaft like a piston... my body rocked back and forth from the immense pleasure. 
 ev051m
 v03wa1140
 ワカバ「Tell, me...」
 v04ce1170
 セロ「...N-no, guu...」
 v03wa1141
 ワカバ「...Geez, you're so stubborn... nngh...」
 Wakaba started feeling her own breasts, and moaning.
 ev051k
 v03wa1142
 ワカバ「...It is still cute for a girl... to be doing something like this?」
 v04ce1171
 セロ「...That's, of course. Since, I love you after all...」
 ev051l
 v03wa1143
 ワカバ「I'm so happy... then, I'll do it to you more...」
 As her tongue wrapped around my shaft, and she panted between her moans, my world started turning into a white mist.
 v04ce1172
 セロ「...W-Wakaba... S-stop!」
 ev051k
 v03wa1144
 ワカバ「W-why...?」
 v04ce1173
 セロ「I-I said st...!」
 I couldn't hold back any longer as I frantically grabbed her.
 ...and then.

 セロ「...Sorry... Wakaba...」
 ev051j
 v03wa1147
 ワカバ「...Uh, no, it's okay.」
 Looking at that smile of hers, feigning satisfaction, I felt more guilty than happy.
 I mustn't let this end just yet, since I haven't satisfied her.
 
 black450
 Just a few minutes after I'd ejaculated...
 ev052c
 v03wa1148
 ワカバ「...I-it's fine, Cero. You don't have to push yourself.」
 v04ce1176
 セロ「I'm not pushing myself.」
 I was thankful for my swift recovery that even I myself couldn't believe.
 ev052a
 v03wa1149
 ワカバ「...B-but... aaah...」
 After hugging her from behind, I slowly lifted her up.
 v04ce1177
 セロ「Look, just like this...」
 I used my fingers to confirm the location for her entrance, then slowly lowered her onto my hips.
 ev052b
 v03wa1150
 ワカバ「Ah... it hurts...」
 v04ce1178
 セロ「...Try to endure it for a while. You'll feel good later on.」
 Though I said that, I had no idea where my confidence came from.
 v03wa1151
 ワカバ「...D-do your best... then.」
 Her body tensed up, and she put her hands around my waist. I too, supported her from her back, making sure I was able to stop whenever I wanted.
 
 ev052a
 v03wa1152
 ワカバ「Nn... aahh...」
 At first I felt pressure upon my shaft, but then it transformed into a feeling of warmth.

 v03wa1153
 ワカバ「Ah, ah... i-is it all in...?」
 v04ce1179

 She didn't have to really look to know... that we'd joined together.

 v04ce1180

 v04ce1181
 セロ「Don't force yourself, okay?」
 ev052o
 v03wa1156
 ワカバ「It's alright... since, it will become pleasant later on, right?」
 Wakaba, who believed what I had said, started moving her hips up and down.
 ev052n
 v03wa1157
 ワカバ「Nghaaa... ah... ah...」
 v04ce1182
 セロ「...Wakaba...」
 v03wa1158
 ワカバ「...I can feel... you, Cero...」
 Her body trembled, and her grip on my waist grew tighter.
 ev052m
 v03wa1159
 ワカバ「This... feels so weird... nghaaa...」
 v04ce1183
 セロ「...I-is that so?」
 v03wa1160
 ワカバ「B-but... I guess, this feels... good...」
 v04ce1184
 セロ「...Really?」
  I tried gently bucking my hips, and watched her reaction.
 ev052n
 v03wa1161
 ワカバ「Un... un, un...」
 Wakaba nodded to me and showed her answer with her body. Wrapped within her soft walls, I felt a sense of numbness.
 
 ev052o
 v03wa1162
 ワカバ「Are you... feeling good, too, Cero?」
 Wakaba looked at me with dazed eyes,
 v04ce1185
 セロ「Can't you feel it?
 I'm slowly getting bigger.」
  as I answered that to her,
 I then purposely moved inside of her while speaking.
 ev052n
 v03wa1163
 ワカバ「Fuaa... haa, haa... n-ngh!」
 I pumped my shaft inside of her body.
 ev052m
 v03wa1164
 ワカバ「...Aah, I, I can... feel it...」
 ev052n
 v03wa1165
 ワカバ「―Haa, haa, haa, ahn, aahn!」
 As Wakaba's moaning go louder and louder, my body responded by increasing its strength.
 v04ce1186
 セロ「...Wakaba...」
 ev052o
 v03wa1166
 ワカバ「...Cero...」
 Though I knew it was impossible for me to see clearly from behind her, I still leaned forward to try and take a look at her expression.
 v04ce1187
 セロ「Look over here...」
 ev052n
 v03wa1167
 ワカバ「...Ce... Cero...」
 Due to our difference in height, I was able to see Wakaba's face―
 v03wa1168
 ワカバ「N-no... d-don't look at me...」
 I could even see clearly the area where we were joined as one.
 v04ce1188
 セロ「...It really did go in nicely.」
 Below the moonlight the moist area shone where the blood of her virginity flowed.
 ev052m
 v03wa1169
 ワカバ「I told you... to stop looking...」
 As if in resistance, Wakaba raised up her chin, and pleaded a kiss from me.
 v04ce1189
 セロ「...Nn...」
 ev052n
 v03wa1170
 ワカバ「Nghaa, aah...」
 Due to the angle that we were trying to kiss at, only the saliva from the end of our lips managed to reach the other person...
 While trying to pursue that sensation, gradually, my lower body started taking over my consciousness.
 v03wa1171
 ワカバ「Ce-Cero... I-if you don't say anything... I...」
 v04ce1190
 セロ「Wakaba... I love you...」
 ev052o
 v03wa1172
 ワカバ「...I-I feel like my mind, aah, is, going to just fly away...!」
 v04ce1191
 セロ「...Wakaba... Wakaba...」
 I kept on calling out her name as if it were an incantation, and each time I did, my feelings too quickened their speed towards my limit―
 
 v04ce1192
 セロ「...I-I don't think, I can hold back... much longer...」
 v03wa1173
 ワカバ「Uh, uh... yes, m-me... me too...」
 As we both approached our limit, we increased the intensity of our actions like there was no tomorrow.
 ev052n
 v03wa1174
 ワカバ「Ah, ah... aah...」
 As she continued pleading for a kiss, breathing heavily, I planted a kiss on her cheek.
 When that final moment approached, I pressed her body firmly down on mine with all my might.
 v04ce1193
 セロ「Wa, Wakaba...」
 ev052m
 v03wa1175
 ワカバ「Ah, aaaaa, aaaaaaa!」
 white450

 v04ce1194

 Those sudden waves of pleasure made my hips buck again and again.

 ワカバ「Ah, ah, ah... aah, it's hot...」
 white450
 ev052s
 v03wa1177
 ワカバ「...C-Cero's... is... aaah...」
 Witnessing Wakaba's exhaustion, I too collapsed behind her, just like that.
 v04ce1195
 セロ「Wakaba... are you okay?」
 ev052u
 v03wa1178
 ワカバ「Y-yup... I felt... really... good...」
 The night wind blew past, beneath our feet, and slowly sapped our warmth. If this goes on, we might get a cold, but―
 
 ev052s
 v03wa1179
 ワカバ「...Cero. Let's just stay like this for a while. Just like this...」
 v04ce1196
 セロ「...Okay.」
 We decided to stay as we were for a while longer.

 I can't rely on other people all the time.

 アンジ「（―Christina. What was going through your mind, back then?）」
 
 The last monarch of the White Kingdom - Christina Dorn.
 
 \p\wBetrayed by her regent, Ein Ronberg, she lost her life to him at a young age and faded into the darkness of history... so the story goes.
 It's a tragic tale of a princess who lost everything to the treason of a vassal whom she trusted.
 That's why, today―
 
 
 v00an0020
 アンジ「（―Surely, something she never could have hoped for remains...）」
 black450
 
 The tale of Christina's sorrow and Ein's cruelty was passed down from generation to generation, so as not to be forgotten, and eventually became a historical drama.
 
 But I feel like Christina's true appeal lies not within the contents of the play itself.

 ワカバ「...Fufufu~n, fuffu―♪ n―, n―? n―!?」
 
 sv006a
 I stopped typing, and my eyes roamed over the sentence that I'd just put down on paper.
 
 v03wa0002
 ワカバ「Noooo! This isn't what I meant to write!」
 
 
 
 As I'd started writing in earnest, I had wandered terribly off topic.
 Making sure no one saw, I obliterated the line in question with a barrage of asterisks.
 
 
 Something like this always happens when I get into the swing of things.
 v03wa0003
 ワカバ「...I've gotta be more careful.」
 Sentences are delicate things. Tweak just one word, and you can turn a foul-tempered old hag into a lovable grandma.
 
 When I was little, I realized how magical this switch was, so I decided ‘I'm definitely going to become a novelist!,’ but...
 
 v03wa0004
 ワカバ「―But in the real world, things never happen that easily.」
 Helping out in my mother's shop, looking after my younger brother, and browsing the bookstore make night come just like that.
 
 When I get to sit at the typewriter, roll up my sleeves and exhort myself, it's time to sleep already.
 
 sv006c
 v03wa0005
 ワカバ「Ah... even though it's summer and I ought to have more time...」
 Day after day, there's all kinds of chores I need to do, and it's really no different than usual.
 
 v03wa0006
 ワカバ「I can't make my debut like this...」
 I want to become a novelist the whole world has heard of, who can write stories that thrill everybody...
 
 v03wa0007
 ワカバ「（―If I tell anybody that, I'll sound like a nincompoop.）」
 The world doesn't owe me a thing until I prove my worth.
  I know that. I know that, but―
 v03wa0008
 ワカバ「Ugh, I just want to hear someone's words of enthusiasm!」
 I've given my story outlines to several of my friends to read and asked for their opinions, but their answers have all been the same.
 
 v03wa0009
 ワカバ「―‘Let me read it when you're finished’... nothing but that!」
 What about your thoughts?
 Your expectations?
 Is that all you can say?
 I just want to hear... something a bit more heartfelt.
 
 Is it selfish or extravagant of me to demand that?
 v03wa0010
 ワカバ「...It's getting hard to keep going.」
 The story that I'm typing up now... I wonder how long it's been since I started writing it.
 
 At first, I made up my mind to finish it in a month and then send it to a publisher.
 
 But somewhere in the middle, I began slacking off for a day, two days... then succumbed to writer's block and started going to bed without writing at all.
 
 v03wa0011
 ワカバ「I wonder if the theme's no good?」
 Love stories are popular among young and old, in the east and the west... I thought that one would work out as long as I avoided making it too boring.
 
 But whenever I sit down at the typewriter, it feels like there's some kind of barrier in front of me, and my hands won't budge.
 
 v03wa0012
 ワカバ「Um, ‘Back then, I could not shake off his arm, and...’ No, that isn't right.」
 
 Even though I've decided what will happen later on, I couldn't figure out how to get there.
 
 For instance, if the setting were a meal, I wouldn't have any trouble writing that.
 
 But, a love scene isn't so easy.
 v03wa0013
 ワカバ「...If I search my heart, an answer will come to me.」
 
 ...Yeah, yeah. I get that even without having to recite the proverb. But, when it comes to love, I don't have that many answers...
 
 v03wa0014
 ワカバ「It's not that I'm making excuses, I just... don't know how to put it into words.」
 That is to say, even I've had a crush once or twice.
 But I haven't any idea how to convey that feeling in words.
 ...Because I―
 v03wa0015
 ワカバ「―Well, I've never actually confessed or been confessed to.」
 How can a person who's never conveyed their feelings in person express them in writing to a total stranger?
 
 I can't imagine anything beyond someone confessing to me and leaving me speechless.
 
 No matter what kind of fiction, if there isn't some sense of the author's personal experience... the story won't ‘ring true,’ so to speak.

 If I continue a little more, I'll reach the most exciting part of the story, so I'll stop for now.

 That story about the kids' treasure hunt, or the tragic ghost who appears in the window every night... which should I do?
 v03wa0018
 ワカバ「The treasure hunt, I've written up to them finding the fifth key― and the ghost has made her sixth appearance?」
 
 Repeating something over and over like that is just a waste of words, though.
 v03wa0019
 ワカバ「Haa, which one... I'm not really enthusiastic about either of them.」
 If I had to choose, I guess the former would be better, since it's a kids' story.

 ワカバ「Then, what should I do? Give that shoddy ghost story another try?」

 That was the name of a real princess who once ruled the White Kingdom.
 It's a famous tale that I hardly need to rewrite.

 Up until now, it's not something I've thought of writing about even once.

 Cero wasn't on top of the bed, or in the gap between the bookcases.

 If Cero isn't here, I'm in a pickle.

 We can't play hide and seek without eating first.

 With that thought, I tottered downstairs into the living room.
 And there―

 Cero was sleeping on the sofa.
 I'd passed through this room a little while ago, but hadn't seen him.

 I won't know until Cero wakes up.
 v02co1120

 I wonder if I can make breakfast?
 \nIt would make things easier for Cero...
 ...Yeah. Today, I'm gonna make breakfast!
 v02co1121
 ココ「Ce-ro―. What's, for, break, fast―?」
 v04ce0004

 Ham, eggs, frying pan... is that everything?
 v02co1123

 First, they're in the fridge, the fridge.
 I opened the door, and shivered from the draft.

 ...Ah, I messed up. My hands are full and I can't close the door.
 v02co1125
 ココ「...Ehehe.」
 But, but, I'm fine.
 At times like this, just push it closed with your back―
 Though since Cero is tall, it's his butt. For me, it's my baaack.
 v02co1126
 ココ「Next, is―」 
 The frying pan.
 The frying pan is in the kitchen cabinet―

 It's no good. I can't open the door to the cabinet with my back.

 I did things in the wrong order.
 I should get the frying pan out first, then the eggs and ham... That's how.
 It's like a puzzle.

 I'll ask Cero to finish the rest.

 I haven't been in the best physical condition lately, but I didn't think things were this bad.
 ...I can't feel my right arm.
 v04ce0007
 セロ「（―This isn't good.）」
 If I can't even turn the pages of a book, I'm not going to be able to take care of Coco.
 
 
 
 But why didn't I notice this earlier?
 v04ce0008
 セロ「...Ah...」
 \nI get it.

 When I fell asleep on the sofa, I was using my right arm as a pillow and it grew numb from the pressure.
 
 v04ce0009
 セロ「(―That's good.)」
 I lifted my head in relief. But suddenly, an indescribably awful feeling welled up inside me.
 
 
 v04ce0010
 セロ「...Urgh...」
 I've really got to sleep properly in a bed at night.
 ...But, even though I regret it every time, I end up on this sofa in the living room.
 
 I know it's a vice inherited from my late father, but I can't just stop.
 v04ce0011
 セロ「(―Should I just move the bed and bookshelves into the living room?)」
 If I did that, I won't fall asleep on the sofa again.
 v04ce0012
 セロ「(―That's a pretty frivolous thought.)」
 If I did that, I'm sure the living room would keep on getting even more cluttered.
 
 It would be all right if I lived on my own, but I've got a little Sister to worry about.
 
 
 Since she wants to imitate everything I do, pretty soon we'd be living in a jungle of furniture.
 v04ce0013
 セロ「...Huh?」
 Speaking of that, where did Coco wander off to anyway?
 Did she go to sleep in her room?
 Or maybe she's playing outside?
 I opened my eyes, squinting against the morning light.
 v04ce0014
 セロ「...Coco?」 
 I tried calling softly.
 But since no answer came after a while, she didn't seem to be anywhere nearby.
 Maybe she's playing her favorite game, one-person hide and seek. Or maybe not.
 v04ce0015
 セロ「(―Well, whatever...)」
 If she went out to play this early in the morning, she'll get hungry and come back soon.
 But, I hadn't wound her spring up yet today.
 
 
 v04ce0016
 セロ「(―Will she be all right?)」
 I'm a bit worried, but if I go out to look for her, I'm more worried she won't know where to find me.

 セロ「(―Good things come to those who wait... so they say.)」
 If I keep napping, she'll definitely come back and wake me up.

 ココ「......Wha-wa―?」
 v04ce0020
 セロ「(―Ah, of course.)」
 Coco's words are something you can understand even while half-asleep.
 I had meant to answer her earlier, but instead of my voice, a yawn came out.
 v02co1104
 ココ「Ce-ro―?」
 v04ce0021
 セロ「(―Eh? Is her voice getting farther away?)」
 
 Judging from the puttering of her feet, it sounded like she'd gone to look for me in my room.
 
 v02co1105
 ココ「I, came, back―」 
 v04ce0022
 セロ「(―I'm over here, Coco.)」
 v02co1106

 Though I was going to repeat myself more loudly, I thought she'd come back down soon enough.
 
 v04ce0023

 Just a bit longer―
 v02co1113

 Somehow, she indulged my selfish request.

 Another ten minutes and I'll be ready.

 Yesterday, we'd had salad and bread with cheese melted on top.
 So, today―

 v02co1122

 The delivery boy often comes to play with Coco. His name is Light.
 His mother runs the bakery, and has him deliver three bottles of milk to me per day.
 
 
 Since she sells them to me almost at cost, telling me ‘Thank you for looking after my son,’ I'm quite grateful to her.
 
 v04ce0039
 セロ「(―-But it's Coco who needs looking after more than he does.)」
 
 As for me... Ever since I moved here, Light and his older sister, Wakaba, have done me all sorts of favors, so I'm in debt to them too.

 Ours is the very last delivery, so he probably hasn't left the shop.

 Although there's nothing of particular value in my house, if my collection of books were stolen, I'd be unable to study.

 I was walking to Cero's house along with Coco, carrying one of the three milk bottles in my hand.

 ココ「Kaba―, you?」
 v03wa0080

 As Coco hid her face with both hands, I couldn't help but pat her on the head.

 It's not like I'm doing anything wrong here. There's no need to worry.

 st02_a02

 Smiling, Coco stuffs the cream bun into her mouth with both hands.
 
 It reminded me of Light when he was little, and I couldn't help but smile.

 After Coco had finished eating, I wiped her mouth a second time.
 Usually, I only have a chance to talk to Cero when my brother's here playing with Coco.
 
 It's rare for me to come to Cero's place with just Coco. I'm a bit unsure how things will go.

 Coco puffed up with pride, seeming to enjoy being called a big sister.
 
 v03wa0096

 The other day, I tried asking Cero about when Coco was made.
 
 
 v04ce0083
 セロ「Before my time, or even my father's. A long time ago, I hear.」 is what he said, but it only made me more curious.

 Coco stopped, and began swinging her head in a rhythm.

 st02_a03
 After reaching ten, she looked at both her hands, then at me, then at the sky, then at a hawk circling above―

 v03wa0101
 ワカバ「Um, you're holding the milk, so be careful...」
 As we chatted, she'd begun to run in a circle around me, forgetting our conversation.
 
 I bet even she doesn't remember how long she's lived... so I decided to leave it at that.
 
 v03wa0102
 ワカバ「Okay, playtime's over! Let's go home, or Cero will be worried.」
 
 
 st02_b01
 v02co1191
 ココ「Yeah, yeah. Go, home―」
 If only my brother were this obedient... so I thought, as I urged Coco onward towards Cero's at a brisk pace.
 
 
 
 I had a reason for wanting to meet him today.
 It wasn't just that I wanted to weasel out of my chores, or that I desperately wanted to see him again... no, not for a petty reason like that.

 st02_a01

 The reason I'm here is because of what I have in my bag.

 On our way back, when I was chatting with Wakaba about what we'll do over the summer break, I suddenly remembered something from long ago.
 black450
 It was back when Coco and I had just moved to Moosgrun.
 Because our new house was located far from the town center, I had decided to explore the town.
 
 So I asked Coco to watch the house while I went out for a stroll.
 And the first place I went to was―

 v03wa0108
 ワカバ「Then what is it? Tell me―」
 
 v04ce0087
 セロ「O, okay. Quit pouting like that.」
 As Wakaba crossed her arms just like that time before, I held in my laughter.

 Not that Wakaba had done anything.
  ...If anything, it was my fault.
 Srhn_BGM07

 v03wa0109
 ワカバ「Welcome―!」
 v04ce0088
 セロ「...Ah, hello.」
 After I had entered the bakery and looked around inside, suddenly Wakaba had appeared beside me.
 I had only come in to ask where the bank and town hall were, but just when I was about to...
 st03_a00
 v03wa0110
 ワカバ「Here's a tray and the tongs.」
 Before I knew it, my hands were full.
 v04ce0089
 セロ「...Um...」
 v03wa0111
 ワカバ「Hm? A recommendation? All of our baked goods are delicious, but if you insist...」
 
 
 I'd never been ‘helped’ quite so forcefully in a bakery before. I was bewildered.
 
 st03_a01
 But, without paying any heed to me at all, she showed me five types of bread and then grinned expectantly at me.
 
 It felt like not buying anything would be rude, so I placed one of the recommended loaves on my tray.
 
 st03_a05
 v03wa0112
 ワカバ「My, is one enough for you?」
 v04ce0090
 セロ「...Then, I'll take that one too.」
 st03_a07
 v03wa0113
 ワカバ「Only two?」
 v04ce0091
 セロ「...Then, I'll take everything you recommended.」
 st03_a09
 v03wa0114
 ワカバ「Eh-!? Wa, wait, wait a minute!」
 
 It seemed like she was shocked I had taken her recommendations seriously.
 Please reconsider, it's not like I'm forcing you to buy these... She even explained that to me.
 v04ce0092
 セロ「No, I actually just wanted to ask directions...」
 st03_a18
 v03wa0115
 ワカバ「So that's what it was... Then say so sooner! I'm so embarrassed.」
 
 black450
 Leaving aside the question of who should have said something, I apologized to her for coming into the shop even though I wasn't planning to buy anything.
 bg02a01

 v04ce0094
 セロ「...You may say that, but it's not an episode that is so easily forgotten.」
 I didn't mean to tease her, but I really didn't think I would forget it.
 Since then, even though I get along with Wakaba, whenever I'm faced with her strong attitude... my conditioned reflex is to give in to her.
 
 st03_a06
 v03wa0117
 ワカバ「I'm not trying to make excuses, but I had things on my mind at the time.」
 v04ce0095

 ワカバ「―There aren't many customers early in the morning, and even though I'd rather have been doing something else, I was stuck watching the shop. Also...」

 st03_a07
 v03wa0119
 ワカバ「The bread that I baked, not a single loaf of it had sold.」
 v04ce0097

 v03wa0120a
 ワカバ「That's right. The bread that I recommended to you, all of those were baked by me.」
 st03_a08
 v03wa0120b
 ワカバ「...Got a problem?!」
 I doubted I could have said so, even if I did.
 v04ce0098
 セロ「Of course not.」
 I didn't remember getting a stomach ache or anything afterwards, so...
 st03_a06
 v03wa0121
 ワカバ「...Really? You're not going to demand your money back or something like that?」
 
 v04ce0099
 セロ「Ahaha, I wouldn't do that.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0122
 ワカバ「I, I see. ...Then, I'll give this to you.」
 v04ce0100
 セロ「Hm? This is...」
 
 As I peeked inside the bag, there was a familiar paper package.
 
 From the smell floating out from the mouth of the bag... inside it must be freshly baked bread.
 Some were even those five varieties of bread we'd talked about earlier.
 v04ce0101
 セロ「Did you bake these?」
 st03_a03
 v03wa0123
 ワカバ「...Nope. This time it was Mom.」
 v04ce0102
 セロ「I see. Can you thank her for me?」
 st03_a06
 v03wa0124
 ワカバ「Ugh. Even though I'm the one who brought it for you...」
 Wakaba grumbled, and put the bread back into the bag as if she were hiding it.
 v04ce0103
 セロ「But your mom is the one who asked you to bring it to me, right?」
 st03_a02
 v03wa0125
 ワカバ「Nope.」
 v04ce0104
 セロ「...That means...」
 v03wa0126
 ワカバ「It's not like I stole them, and they aren't leftovers either.」
 Even though I hadn't accused her of that, I wasn't sure I could take her word for it.
 st03_a00
 v03wa0127
 ワカバ「This time, I put the money for it in the cash register, too.」
 v04ce0105
 セロ「How much were they? I'll pay.」
 
 st03_a10
 v03wa0128
 ワカバ「It's fine! You don't have to do that. Today, it's my treat.」
 
 That does make me happy, but looking at that extraordinarily bright smile... Somehow, I felt uneasy.
 v04ce0106

 st03_a00
 v03wa0129
 ワカバ「But, if it bothers you that much...」

 She usually finds some kind of excuse so that I give in.
 st03_a06

 v04ce0108
 セロ「No, it's nothing. So, if it bothers me...?」
 st03_a01
 v03wa0131
 ワカバ「I'll exchange it for your wisdom. How is that?」
 v04ce0109
 セロ「My wisdom? Even though I only know about history?」
 
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa0132
 ワカバ「That's exactly what I need to ask you about.」
 As Wakaba nodded in satisfaction, I tilted my head curiously.
 v04ce0110
 セロ「(―Hmm. Maybe it's about her summer homework?)」
 Usually it's me asking favors of Wakaba. I'd never considered that she might have a request of me.
 
 
 v04ce0111
 セロ「(―But, well, if she really wants to...)」
 st03_a02
 v03wa0133
 ワカバ「Ah, but! You have to listen to what I have to say first, okay?」
 
 v04ce0112
 セロ「...Uh, yeah. Sure.」
 st03_a01
 v03wa0134
 ワカバ「Well, we'll talk about that when we reach your place, okay?」
 Wakaba thumped her fist against her bag, and laughed in satisfaction.
 st03_a05
 ...Then, just as I thought she might return to her serious expression...
 st03_a07
 She became crestfallen instead.
 v04ce0113
 セロ「What happened?」
 st03_a14
 v03wa0135
 ワカバ「I think I just... crushed the bread.」
 v04ce0114
 セロ「...Er.」

 ワカバ「There were cream buns, too...」
 v04ce0115

 If she only thought a bit more about the consequences of her actions, she'd be a good girl.

 But that part of her is what makes her Wakaba... When I thought of it like that, I wasn't bothered by it.
 
 ―Though I couldn't say I wasn't bothered by squashed cream buns.

 v04ce0117
 セロ「...Now, the place where the problem was...」
 Though I've gotten used to living together with Coco, I still wasn't very good at taking care of the house.
 
 When my father was still around, I should have helped him out and not left everything to him, but I guess it's too late now.
 v04ce0118
 セロ「Is it around here?」
 When I was in the kitchen earlier, I'd felt a drop of water from a leak.
 There had been a rainstorm the day before yesterday. I hadn't considered if it might have damaged the roof.
 st04_c07
 v04ce0119
 セロ「But I never thought that the preparations alone would take so much time...」
 I had looked up at the roof, consulted my book on do-it-yourself carpentry, and went to fetch the ladder and other necessities from that shed I rarely entered.
 
 ...Before I knew it, half an hour had already passed.
 st04_c06
 v04ce0120
 セロ「(―At this rate, Coco will be back before I'm done.)」
 If it were possible, I'd like to finish this before she got home.
 st04_c00

 Luckily I had managed to pinpoint its location, and it was even within reach of my ladder.
 
 st04_c00

 セロ「Oopsy... daisy...」
 As I lifted the piece of pottery tile, I found the underside was moist. The leak had saturated the nearby area.
 
 
 st04_c05
 v04ce0123
 セロ「...Oh, dear. Well, at least it didn't rot.」
 I tried to think positively. If the wind keeps up all day long, it ought to dry out, right?
 st04_c00
 v04ce0124
 セロ「I'll take another look tomorrow. If it's no better, I'll call a repairman.」
 If an indoor person like me were to try fixing something like this, it wouldn't end well.
 \p\wWhat's more, if Coco saw me climbing up to the roof with a ladder―
 st04_c03
 v04ce0125
 セロ「...She'd definitely want to climb up too.」
 That was what worried me the most.
 After all, Coco loves to climb to high places and look out into the distance.
 But often, she can't climb back down on her own and needs my help.
 I've lost count of how many times I've had to rescue Coco as she wails from a high treetop.
 v02co1193
 ココ「―Ce-ro-?」
 Even though she was still far away, I could hear Coco's voice clearly.
 st04_c05
 v04ce0126
 セロ「...Whoa, back already!?」
 I hurried down from the roof and hid the ladder in the shed before going back out to wait for Coco.
 v04ce0127
 セロ「(―But if she called my name, that must mean that she saw me.)」
 As I was wondering what to do, I saw a figure following behind Coco, made unmistakable by the triangular headscarf that fluttered in the wind.
 
 st04_c05

 I guess she must have met Coco at the shop, then came with her for some reason...

 She seemed in higher spirits then usual today. I wondered if something good had happened to her.

 After barging into my house, without even giving me time to put the tea on, Wakaba had dragged me into my room.
 And then she took out something like a manuscript from her bag and thrust it into my hand.
 
 ...Judging from the sparkle in her eyes, she seemed to be rather proud of it.

 v04ce0137
 セロ「This is still what you'd call a ‘plot outline,’ right?」
 v03wa0145
 ワカバ「Yup, ...so how was it?」
 v04ce0138
 セロ「―Hard to say.」
 v03wa0146
 ワカバ「Eh, why? Ah, maybe you're not familiar with the original story this is adapted from?」
 
 
 v04ce0139
 セロ「I guess it's ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ but I don't really know it that well.」
 That was probably an exaggeration, but I wasn't sure if my knowledge was on par with Wakaba's, so I decided to understate things.

 ワカバ「Then I'll give you a summary.」
 she declared, spinning the pencil in her fingers.
 v03wa0148
 ワカバ「As I'm sure you know, the kingdom we live in now... long ago, it was actually divided into two kingdoms.」
 
 v03wa0149
 ワカバ「There was the Red Kingdom and the Blue Kingdom. Then the two kingdoms created a third kingdom, the ‘White Kingdom,’ which signified their peace.」
 
 v03wa0150
 ワカバ「...but you're a history major... so I must be embarrassing myself here.」
 v04ce0140
 セロ「No, don't worry about that. People who think they know everything are the most frightening sort.」
 ...That's what my father used to tell me.
 History is just the dregs of the past. Only those who were alive at that time can know the truth.
 If future generations want to learn about the past, they can only do so through what we've written down and told to our children.
 
 That ought to be ‘what really happened’, but dubious elements are added to the mix as time passes.
 
 Filtering out these elements and passing the truth on to the next generation is the responsibility of a historian... or so I was taught.
 
 v04ce0141
 セロ「Let's compare our knowledge, then.」
 Being suspicious isn't nice, but I mustn't overlook the chance to confirm and correct my perspective.
 
 v03wa0151
 ワカバ「...Even when it's something we learned as kids? It's the basics of basics.」
 v04ce0142
 セロ「Yeah. Who knows? We may well discover something new.」
 ―even concerning something that basic.
 v03wa0152
 ワカバ「I see. If that's what you think, Cero, I guess I can go with it.」
 
 
 Wakaba, as though rolling up her sleeves, continued her story.
 v03wa0153
 ワカバ「-The White Kingdom was originally ruled by the Dorn family, those born of the marriage between the Red and Blue Kingdoms.」
 v03wa0154
 ワカバ「...And a descendant of that family became the ruler. That ruler issued an order to develop a certain art.」
 
 
 v03wa0155
 ワカバ「...Now then... what kind of art do you think it was?」
 
 
 v04ce0143
 セロ「When did your history lecture turn into a quiz show?」
 v03wa0156
 ワカバ「Hee, I felt like it. It's boring to just go on and on by myself.」
 v04ce0144
 セロ「―Ah, I see.」 Well, it's not unusual for Wakaba to be in a whimsical mood like this.
 
 v03wa0157
 ワカバ「I'll give you a hint... Coco.」
 v04ce0145
 セロ「（-Hm?）」
 She went as far as to provide me with a hint. Could it be a trick question?
 「The White Kingdom... it'd be research about dolls, right?」
 「...Coco, huh?」
 v04ce0146
 「The White Kingdom... it'd be research about dolls, right?」
 I answered a bit nervously.
 v03wa0158
 ワカバ「You got it~♪」
 Wakaba seemed happy as she confirmed my answer.
 v04ce0147
 セロ「...Good. I thought it might have been some sort of trick question.」
 v03wa0159
 ワカバ「Hmmph, and what do you mean by that?」
 v04ce0148
 セロ「Sorry, sorry, just an idle thought. Please continue.」
 v04ce0149
 セロ「...Coco, huh?」
 I didn't know the intent behind Wakaba's words, so I shouldn't blurt out the answer tactlessly―
 v03wa0160
 ワカバ「Ye-yeah, it's about Coco... do you really not know? Or are you playing dumb?」
 
 v04ce0150
 セロ「No, it's not that, but... how should I put it...」
 v03wa0161
 ワカバ「...You don't have to think so hard. Just answering ‘research about dolls’ is fine, right?」
 
 v04ce0151
 セロ「...Ah, ahaha. I see.」
 v03wa0162
 ワカバ「Really, Cero. You sure you aren't still half-asleep?」
 v04ce0152
 セロ「（―I do have this feeling as if she's hurrying me along at her own pace, though.）」
 v04ce0153
 セロ「S, something like that. ...so, what's next?」
 v03wa0163
 ワカバ「Mm... well then, the final ruler of the White Kingdom was Princess Christina.」
 v03wa0164
 ワカバ「As far as dolls are concerned, she'd have been accredited at the highest rank of ‘tuner’ by any educational institution.」
 
 v03wa0165
 ワカバ「...And this time around, she will be one of the heroines in my story.」
 v04ce0154
 セロ「I figured that much. Also...」
 Jotted down in Wakaba's notes, with Princess Christina at the top, were some other names.
 
 All of them were historical figures. Amongst them, the most recognizable one...
 
 v04ce0155
 セロ「...Ein Ronberg.」
 v03wa0166
 ワカバ「Yeah. He's the ‘secret’ hero of this story.」
 v04ce0156
 セロ「―But you're sure casting some characters of pretty ill repute in your story.」
 
 
 v03wa0167
 ワカバ「Ehehe. Well, it is ‘that’ Ein.」
 ―Ein Ronberg.
 The one who served as the guardian of Princess Christina. Even someone ignorant of history would still know about him.
 
 Due in part to the failure of his plan, he assassinated his charge, Princess Christina.
 
 
 But he was captured by the united armies of the Red and Blue Kingdoms, led by a doll trained by the princess while she was still alive. ...That is what history says.
 
 v03wa0168
 ワカバ「The plot I'm showing you now is a historical drama, based on ‘The Angel's Guidance.’」
 
 Some call it the ‘cursed play.’
 
 
 The reason for that is whenever a performance of ‘The Angel's Guidance’ has been put on, it has ended in failure... this rumor has persisted through the ages.
 
 
 Over the years, it's not only the original play, ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ that has been affected; even novels, TV and movie adaptations are haunted by the ‘curse.’
 
 
 v04ce0157
 - セロ「Well, you've got some courage, tackling as notorious a story as this.」
 
 
 I don't usually believe in such superstitions.
 As I recalled that news, I couldn't help but have second thoughts.
 
 
 v03wa0169
 ワカバ「I haven't decided if I want to write the whole story. That's because I wanted to hear your opinion on it first.」
 v04ce0158
 セロ「Mine?」
 v03wa0170
 ワカバ「Yup, a historian's perspective.」
 v04ce0159
 セロ「But I'm just a history student.」
 v03wa0171
 ワカバ「-Then think of it as advice from a would-be historian to a would-be novelist. How's that?」
 
 Judging from the look in Wakaba's eyes, she wasn't flattering me. It felt as if she were entrusting her whole future to me.
 
 v04ce0160
 セロ「...But there is something I want to ask first.」
 v03wa0172
 ワカバ「Please do.」
 v04ce0161
 セロ「...Judging by this plot summary, you're trying to make Ein the Betrayer into a sympathetic character.」
 Though it was just a rough draft, there were various comments such as ‘So cool!!’ and ‘How kind!!’ scrawled down.
 
 v03wa0173
 ワカバ「That's right.」
 Does that mean, she'll make him appear loyal until the end?
 v04ce0162
 セロ「There aren't any scenes of conspiracy or plotting so far. Is he going to suddenly betray her in the final scene?」
 
 v03wa0174
 ワカバ「I haven't thought about that yet, but he won't be betraying her.」
 v04ce0163
 セロ「Eh?」
 v03wa0175
 ワカバ「Well, from the way the story's been flowing so far, he doesn't seem the betraying sort, does he?」
 v04ce0164
 セロ「Ye, yeah, that's why I'm asking...」
 v03wa0176
 ワカバ「That's my question, too.」
 Understanding Wakaba's conversations is like bumbling through a maze sometimes.
 She'd arrived at her point without explaining how she got there... I'm having trouble keeping up with her pace.
 
 v04ce0165
 セロ「Er, what's your question? Is it that you don't know how to conclude this, so you're asking me?」
 
 v03wa0177
 ワカバ「Half right. I wanted to consult you about portraying Ein as a ‘good person’ in the story, from the beginning to the end.」
 
 v04ce0166
 セロ「Why me?」
 v03wa0178
 ワカバ「That's because... I thought I said that already. I wanted to know if this is ‘possible,’ in the opinion of a history expert.」
 
 v04ce0167
 セロ「Hmm... I don't feel like it's something I can really offer advice on.」
 For the one known to history as the greatest of traitors, Ein, to not actually betray anyone in the end...
 ...can a story like that really be written?
 v04ce0168
 セロ「(―Well, I'm sure Wakaba can figure it out.)」
 v03wa0179
 ワカバ「Why, why? Is it too ridiculous? Can't work?」
 
 
 v04ce0169
 セロ「It's not that it can't work, but even if you ask me, I'm afraid I can't be of much help.」
 v03wa0180
 ワカバ「W-why is that!? Don't you always give me your opinion when you read my stories?」
 
 v04ce0170
 セロ「Yeah. Those were my opinions as a reader. But now you're asking me for a historian's perspective.」
 
 v03wa0181
 ワカバ「???」
 v04ce0171
 セロ「...Wakaba. I'm sure you know this, but humans don't have the power to change the past.」
 v04ce0172
 セロ「At least, the historical truth won't change. I mean, I haven't seen Ein with my own eyes.」
 
 I didn't mean to be unkind to her.
 ...But when it comes to my specialty, I can't just withhold my opinion for the sake of encouraging her.
 
 v03wa0182
 ワカバ「......」
 v04ce0173
 セロ「That's why, I'm sorry, but when it comes to thinking about the story from a historical perspective... I don't have anything to say.」
 v03wa0183
 ワカバ「...I, I see. You're right, ahaha...」
 Even though Wakaba was laughing, she couldn't hide her shock.
 v04ce0174
 セロ「(―Sorry, Wakaba.)」
 I would have liked to have explained it more clearly.
  But as far as history is concerned, I can't help but stick to my principles.
 v03wa0184
 ワカバ「Haaah. I guess it must've been the lack of sleep that made me think this could work.」
 v04ce0175
 セロ「(Wow, she's still acting like she's fine after all that?)」
 
 
 v04ce0176
 セロ「Ho, hold on, Wakaba! I didn't say that it wouldn't work.」
 
 v03wa0185
 ワカバ「...Eh?」
 v04ce0177
 セロ「―This is your original story, isn't it? It's not like you're writing a history book, right?」
 
 
 v03wa0186
 ワカバ「Well, that's true.」
 v04ce0178
 セロ「Then I think there's no problem. It's a rather creative idea.」
 \p\wI felt like I was just trying to console her, but those were my true feelings.
 v03wa0187
 ワカバ「Re, really... you think it's interesting?」
 v04ce0179
 セロ「Very much so.」
 v03wa0188
 ワカバ「Ehehe-, you're right! I knew it would work!」
 
 Wakaba's face brightened up to her usual self.
 v04ce0180
 セロ「(―P-phew...)」
 v03wa0189
 ワカバ「...Oh, then, do you want to see the first draft? Here it is.」
 
 She happily took out another bundle of paper from her bag and presented it to me.
 v04ce0181
 セロ「―Let me see... ‘At that moment, Chiro enfolded her in his arms―’」

 セロ「Huh?」
 Wakaba snatched the manuscript away in a single movement, crumpling the pages in her hands.

 Then, breathing hard, she shut them away in her bag.
 v03wa0191
 ワカバ「Did you see it? Did you read it? Did you... understand it??」 she babbled.
 
 
 
 v04ce0183
 セロ「No, no... only the part that I read out loud...」

 v04ce0184
 セロ「...How can I forget it just like... Ah, seems like I've forgotten it already. Yeah.」
 With her as worked up as she was, I figured I would have to forget it before she would forgive me. I shook my head.

 v03wa0193
 ワカバ「Okay, then that's fine. That's fine. That's fine, but...」
 v04ce0185
 セロ「?」
 She looked up at me, blushing slightly.
 And then, as her face grew ever more crimson,
 v03wa0194
 ワカバ「T-thanks for today! B-bye bye―!」 she shouted, and ran out of the room.
 
 
 v04ce0186
 セロ「Wa, Wakaba?」
 Taken aback by how suddenly it had all happened, I stood there as though frozen.
 
 v03wa0195
 ワカバ「Take care, Coco!」
 v02co1197
 ココ「...Ah-?」
 The moment I heard her deliver her greeting to Coco downstairs, the door slammed shut.

 It's Friday already... almost the end of the week.
 I had thought it would be fun for Coco to go shopping with me in town, but―
 
 v04ce0189
 セロ「If you want to go somewhere on your own, tell me first... that's what we promised, right?」
 st02_a05
 v02co1199
 ココ「Yes. I'm, sorry―」
 We had decided on a meeting place beforehand in case we got separated, but not seeing her behind me when I turn around isn't good for my heart.

 st02_a00
 v02co1200
 ココ「Pidg-eon―, po, po~」
 v04ce0191
 セロ「Pigeon?」
 Indeed, there were some pigeons a few meters away.
 
 
 st02_a01
 v02co1201
 ココ「Imi, tate―」
 Coco pointed to a pigeon, and with her body hunched and her hands behind her back, she started bobbing her head forwards and backwards.
 The pigeon wandered away in search of food, and Coco followed behind it.
 
 v04ce0192
 セロ「...That's why you came here?」
 st02_a02
 v02co1202
 ココ「Yup.」
 While I was in the bookstore, trying to make up my mind, she'd run all the way across the road for this...
 
 v04ce0193

 v02co1203
 ココ「'Kay. Bye, bye―」

 v04ce0195
 セロ「(―Since my father passed away, I've always depended on him.)」
 Just a few months after we came to this city, my father fell ill, and the doctors couldn't do anything... Just like that, he went to heaven.
 
 v04ce0196
 セロ「(Back then, I really didn't know what to do...)」
 Still, my father was well aware of his infirmity. 
 He had talked with that person about our lives once he was gone.
 And now, thanks to that person - Rein Helmer, we are able to live in comfort.
 
 v04ce0197
 セロ「(―If it wasn't for him, I'd have no choice but to work part-time while I study...)」
 
 Our patron Rein had told me, ‘Don't waste that determination of yours. Go and study hard.’
 
 
 
 He had even said that I can pay back my debt in installments once I start working.
 
 v04ce0198
 セロ「...I must say, I am incredibly indebted to Rein.」
 st02_a02
 v02co1205
 ココ「Yeah, yeah.」
 v04ce0199
 セロ「Oh? From the way you're nodding, you understand too, don't you?」
 
 st02_a01
 v02co1206
 ココ「Huh―?」
 Judging from that reaction, it seemed my thoughts were a bit beyond Coco's ability.
 v04ce0200
 セロ「(―But, is this really all right?)」
 Of course, Rein's generosity makes me happy.
 But the degree to which he assists us really is above and beyond what I could comfortably ask for.
 v04ce0201
 セロ「(―It's not like we're related by blood.)」
 I'm still trying to grasp the relationship between Rein and my father.
 The only clue I have is―
 v04ce0202
 セロ「(―it probably involves Coco.)」
 People who have the knowledge and skill to create a Sister like this are known as ‘doll engineers’.
 
 
 
 And among them, Rein is the most knowledgeable of all ― he is considered to be a ‘national treasure’.
 
 Given that, if he's supporting me financially because of my relationship with Coco, somehow... that's easier to accept.
 
 v04ce0203
 セロ「(―My father never told me anything about her, after all.)」
 When my father first brought Coco home, I was just barely old enough to understand other people's conversations.
 
 That's why, to me, Coco was a playmate and a big sister.
 She was part of our family, not something I felt curious to know the origin of.
 
 
 After I grew older, I suppose I could have asked, but I never felt the desire to.
 
 v04ce0204
 セロ「(―And in the end, my father passed away...）」
 Since then I've been living with this Sister who will always be a big sister to me, even though her head only comes up to my waist.
 
 
 st02_a01
 v02co1207
 ココ「Hmm―? What's-, wrong-―?」
 
 v04ce0205
 セロ「It's nothing, Coco.」
 Sisters, older sisters, younger sisters... even though they're all called Sisters, they are still a great mystery.
 
 There are Sisters that you can barely tell apart from real humans, and others like Coco, who are obviously Sisters.
 
 
 
 
 They only have one thing in common- ‘Drop.’ Also known as doll's stone, it's the crystal that provides energy for the Sisters.
 
 \p\wThere aren't many Sisters left nowadays... but in the past, many artisans competed to make them.
 
 
 ...That being said, creating one from scratch takes an immense amount of labor and money, so the Sisters of many different levels of quality exist.
 
 v04ce0206
 セロ「Have you ever seen another Sister like yourself, Coco?」
 
 
 st02_a03
 v02co1208
 ココ「Hm―? Dun, no―」
 
 If I try to follow her thought process, it doesn't seem like she didn't understand my question, but only that it's not available in her memory.
 v04ce0207
 セロ「I see. You're probably the only doll in Moosgrun, in any case.」
 st02_a02
 v02co1209
 ココ「Yup. on- ly, me~」
 At first, the townspeople asked me about her constantly due to what a rare spectacle she was.
 
 \p\wBut now, they just treat her the same as a normal child... I'm sure that won't change in the future, either.

 セロ「Have you done anything naughty lately?」
 st02_a02
 v02co1210
 ココ「Nuh-uh―」
 v04ce0209

 As we chatted, we reached the railway station, and I gave Coco a hug.
 
 v04ce0210
 セロ「Then, it seems like you're growing up.」
 st02_a01
 v02co1211
 ココ「Huh~?」
 She truly is an interesting being.
  Even though she isn't good at talking, it doesn't mean she isn't good at thinking.
 As she lives, she learns little by little, and changes little by little.
 
 Those human traits she possesses might be one of the reasons why she's so well-loved by the townsfolk.
 
 v04ce0211
 セロ「Come, Coco, we're going to the bank.」
 st02_b02
 v02co1212
 ココ「O- kay-」
 After hearing her reply, I felt a sudden impulse to test just how much Coco had matured.
 
 v04ce0212
 セロ「Would you like to try going alone, just for a change?」
 Coco going to the bank alone would be like a little adventure for her.
 ...No, it would be one for me too.
 st02_a10
 v02co1213
 ココ「Yeah, yeah!」
 With a vigorous nod of her head, Coco assumed a proud stance.
 She seemed full of confidence as she took the bank book I handed to her and thumped it against her chest.
 
 v04ce0213
 セロ「Okay, then I'll leave it to you, Coco.」
 ...Even though I'd said that, I was still nervous about leaving Coco alone, so I followed her from a distance.
 
 Coco slowly made her way to the front of the bank, where she paused for a while.
 
 st02_b01
 v02co1214
 ココ「Ah―」
 Suddenly, as if she'd come to an epiphany, she opened the door with both hands and walked in.
 v04ce0214
 セロ「(―Was she at a loss because I'm usually the one who opens the door?)」
 Well, it seems like she's cleared the first obstacle.
 After waiting for some time, I casually opened the door to the bank.
 Feigning a disinterested expression, I glanced around the bank and spotted Coco at the counter.

 As the man gazed at Coco's delighted face, he glanced up at me.
 
 v04ce0217

 Looks like he noticed me a while ago.
 Smiling faintly while nodding his head, he gave me a thumbs-up gesture and continued to serve Coco.

 v02co1221
 ココ「...All, of it―」

 After confirming that, he took Coco's bank book and passed it to another teller across the counter.
 
 v14ba0010
 銀行員「I'll get the money for you right now.」
 v02co1222

 The man smiled as he attended to Coco, as if to say that looking after Coco was his job.
 
 The worker also smiled as he approached from behind and passed the envelope containing the money to Coco.

 After making sure Coco had sat down as he'd said, the man walked over to me.

 セロ「...Uh, it's nothing. Nothing's the matter, but...」
 After leaving the bank, I was still puzzled.
 v04ce0221
 セロ「(―What is Rein up to?)」
 Then, as I took the envelope from Coco, I understood what he meant.
 
 v04ce0222
 セロ「...This is!?」
 v14ba0014
 銀行員「You see? It's an awful lot.」
 
 Inside the envelope was nearly five times as much money as usual.
 
 ―For a moment, I wondered if the man intended to play a prank on Coco, but using this amount of money for a joke is rather excessive.

 セロ「It's the same amount that was written in the bank book...」
 st02_a02
 v02co1225
 ココ「Hmm―?」
 Maybe Rein made an error when he transferred the money?
 v04ce0224
 セロ「No, that seems odd.」
 ―If it were a mistake like putting in an extra digit, then I could somehow understand.
 v04ce0225
 セロ「What's going on? Could he be giving me this in advance?」
 
 If that's the case, he would have told me so beforehand―
 v04ce0226
 セロ「...Ah, perhaps...!」
 Rein usually sends me a letter when it's about time to withdraw the money.
 He might have written an explanation for the added amount in that letter.
 v04ce0227
 セロ「All right, let's hurry. Coco, we're done shopping for today... Huh? Coco? Where did you go!?」
 
 
 Coco, who was supposed to be walking beside me, had vanished.
 I scanned the surrounding area desperately.
 v04ce0228
 セロ「Coco!」
 st02_a01
 v02co1226
 ココ「Ah―?」
 Hearing a response from the shadow under a tree not far away, I sighed in relief.
 It seems she was playing one-person hide and seek again.
 v04ce0230
 セロ「Let's save the hide and seek for another time. We have things to do at home.」
 
 st02_a02
 v02co1228
 ココ「'Kay.」
 I held Coco's hand and began walking briskly.
 st02_b01
 v02co1229
 ココ「Ah-, gonna-, run?」
 v04ce0231
 セロ「Sure. Then let's race home!」
 black450
 bg01a01
 v04ce0232
 セロ「...Hah, hah, hah. I guess... you win, Coco...」
 st02_b02
 v02co1230
 ココ「Ehe, he―. I'm, number- one!」
 I started off with a brisk jog, but it had been a while, and I'd forgotten how strong Coco really was.
 
 Unlike humans, Sisters won't get tired even if they exert themselves for a long period of time.\n
 
 
 Once she starts moving, her pace won't slacken until she reaches her destination.
 
 v04ce0233
 セロ「―It doesn't help that I'm out of shape either.」
 Come to think of it, Light must have pretty good stamina too, seeing as he's always playing with Coco.
 
 v04ce0234
 セロ「...Ah, Coco. Can you bring me the mail?」
 st02_b01
 v02co1231
 ココ「Okay-. I'll, do it―」
 Within the bundle of letters that Coco fetched, one stood out― the orange envelope Rein liked to use was mixed within them.
 
 v04ce0235
 セロ「This is it!」
 black450
 I hurried back to my room with Coco to open the mail.
 bg01b01
 st02_b02
 v02co1232
 ココ「Read it-, read, it―」
 v04ce0236
 セロ「Be patient, I'm reading it now. Let's see...」
 It was written in a simple style, starting with a polite greeting.
 v04ce0237
 セロ「...Is Coco in good health as usual? That's what it says.」
 st02_a02
 v02co1233
 ココ「Healthy-! Very- healthy―」
 v04ce0238
 セロ「So it seems, although you're just as much of a crybaby as ever.」
 st02_b07
 v02co1234
 ココ「Kya―」
 As I patted the embarrassed Coco on the head, I continued reading the letter.
 v04ce0239
 セロ「―It's not anything too urgent, but it's almost time for Coco's tuning- her maintenance...」
 
 st02_a00
 v02co1235
 ココ「Hmm―?」
 v04ce0240
 セロ「...I see. It's been quite a while since I took you to Rein for a check-up.」
 
 The last time was before we even arrived in this town, while my father was still alive― five years ago.
 
 Any minor problems could be easily fixed by asking the doll engineers around town, so I hadn't worried about them much.
 
 ...But he's right.
 It's about time for Coco to receive a proper tuning.
 v11re0001
 レイン「―That's all for now, take care. I've included money for your travel expenses with this month's usual.」
 v11re0002
 レイン「―If by some chance it isn't enough, please just say ‘bill it to Rein instead.’」
 
 
 v04ce0241
 セロ「...Re, Rein... We'll never spend this much money no matter how extravagantly we travel.」
 
 And he even offered us his credit if the money wasn't enough.
 
 
 v04ce0242
 セロ「If I mention Rein's name, there'd be no need to pay at all... It would be free of charge.」
 st02_a03
 v02co1236
 ココ「Free―?」
 v04ce0243
 セロ「Yeah, because Rein is an eminent person. ...Speaking of which, are you looking forward to meeting him, Coco?」
 
 st02_a01
 v02co1237
 ココ「I know, him-? Huh-? Do, I know- him?」
 
 
 v04ce0244
 セロ「That's right. You know him, but maybe you won't recognize him.」
 According to my late father, every time Rein completes Coco's tuning, her memories of him are erased.
 
 That's why, every time Coco meets with Rein, it's as if it's her first meeting.
 
 v04ce0245
 セロ「...Anyway, let's call him and arrange everything. Not setting a time in advance would be unwise.」
 
 
 After letting Coco sit in the middle of the bed, I flipped through the calendar beside my pillow, thinking.
 
 v04ce0246
 セロ「(―Since it's summer break, would it be best for me to go as soon as possible?)」
 
 The village in the highlands where Rein lives in is called Silberg, popular as a tourist destination for its natural beauty.
 
 Departing from Moosgrun, I'll have to transfer to the mountain train via La Renoncule. ...That's the route I was thinking of.
 
 v04ce0247
 セロ「Where is the map, the map...」
 black450
 v02co1238
 ココ「This-?」
 map00
 v04ce0248
 セロ「Oh, nice!」
 I'd never thought that the tourist map Wakaba had given me in the past would come in useful.
 First, to make sure Coco knew, I pointed at Moosgrun.
 v04ce0249
 セロ「This is Moosgrun, while La Renoncule is over there.」
 I pointed at the town where we'd be changing trains.
 v02co1239
 ココ「Yup, yup.」
 v04ce0250
 セロ「And Silberg, where Rein lives... is here.」
 ココ手（指さし）
 v02co1240
 ココ「Oh-, Jil-」
 Coco traced her finger to Silberg along the same course I had drawn with my own.
 v04ce0251
 セロ「Have you heard of it?」
 v02co1241
 ココ「Nope-」
 After shaking her head, she moved her finger north in one stroke, then darted it off to the right side of the map.
 
 v04ce0252
 セロ「Hm? That's the Blue Capital, but what about it?」
 
 The city Coco was pointing at was the site of a prosperous seaport metropolis.
 v02co1242
 ココ「Where-?」
 v04ce0253
 セロ「That's the trading port city, Blew.」
 v02co1243
 ココ「Do you- know-?」
 v04ce0254
 セロ「I've heard of it, yes, but I've never been there before.」
 
 Blew is a metropolis incomparable to a town like Moosgrun.
 It would be nice if I had the chance to go there once.
 v04ce0255
 セロ「(―Huh? But why would Coco...)」
 
 v04ce0256
 セロ「Hey, Coco. Do you know something about the city Blew?」
 v02co1244
 ココ「Hm-? Dun, no.」
 
 v04ce0257
 セロ「...I see. I thought so.」
 map00
 Letting Coco hold the map open with her arms spread wide, I looked at it as I reached for the phone.
 
 v04ce0258
 セロ「(How about the express train from La Renoncule to... no, no. I can't do that just because money isn't a problem.)」
 
 As I dialed Rein's number, I was trying to figure out the cheapest route for our trip, but I struggled to decide on anything.
 
 map00
 It's times like this when my ineptitude with numbers really gets to me.
 v04ce0259
 セロ「(―Should I just figure it all out on paper before I call him?)」
 I'll calculate how much I can reasonably expect to spend during this trip.
 black450
 After that, I can return the excess money to Rein.
  There's no way I'll ever need this much―
 bg01b01
 v04ce0260
 セロ「(―But he'll probably just use it all to buy me a bunch of books... how frightening.)」
 v11re0003
 レイン「...Hello? To whom am I speaking?」
 
 st02_a02
 v02co1245
 ココ「Ce-ro―, phone, call―」
 black450
 v04ce0261
 セロ「...Ah, oh no! S-sorry! Hello, it's Cero from Moosgrun! Thanks for always taking care of me...」
 
 
 
 I grabbed the receiver, and started talking.

 Sharp of my brother, talking to me just as I'm finishing up this paragraph and about to begin the next.
 v03wa0198
 ワカバ「Shh, shh! Don't talk to me when I'm working.」
 
 st05_a03
 But now, my fingers won't stop no matter what.
 The continuation of ‘The Story of the White Kingdom’ which Cero praised so highly... it's already outlined within my head.

 v03wa0200

 v03wa0202
 ワカバ「What is it, then? That candy we got the other day?」
 
 In that case, I guess I'll take a break... no, I mustn't! If I let this moment of inspiration slip by, I'll be wasting a lot of paper later.
 
 At times like these, one must have self-discipline―
 st05_a00
 v05li0114
 ライト「Well, it's just that Uncle Cero came to buy some stuff.」
 v03wa0203
 ワカバ「Tell me something like that sooner, idiot!」
 I quickly finished the sentence I was typing, and told Light,
 v03wa0204
 ワカバ「Give me a minute!」 as he headed down the stairs.
 
 Even though writing is important, talking to Cero is much more important. How should I say it... that's right, because he's my adviser!
 
 Particularly for this work, he's essential.
 black450
 v05li0115
 ライト「Hmmm. Once Uncle Cero's name comes up, your reaction's so different. ...Which one's more important, your work or Uncle Cero?」
 
 v03wa0205
 ワカバ「Idiot!」
 That... there's no comparison there.
 Though I wanted to say that, I knew I didn't have the time. So I rushed to the door of the shop at once.
 
 bg04a01
 As I'd thought, having finished with his purchase, Cero was walking towards the exit.

 v03wa0207
 ワカバ「I see. ...Then, are you busy after this?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0264

 v03wa0208
 ワカバ「Did that brat tell you I wasn't home?」
 st04_a04
 v04ce0265

 v03wa0209

 v03wa0210
 ワカバ「(―Hmmph. No matter what, I wouldn't do something like that.)」
 st04_a01
 v04ce0266
 セロ「But I felt that loitering in the store after I finished my shopping wasn't polite, so I thought I'd wait outside.」
 
 v03wa0211
 ワカバ「It's fine even if you wait inside, you know.」
 ...Sometimes Cero is really unusually honest.
 v03wa0212
 ワカバ「So, what did you want to talk to me about? ...Ah, wait! Let me guess.」
 
 
 \nCaught up in the flow of things, I declared that without thinking, and Cero nodded wordlessly.
 v03wa0213
 ワカバ「(―Um... now what...?)」
 「...What could it be? Hey, what is it?」
 「...About the future?」
 「...About our plans for the summer break?」
 v03wa0214
 ワカバ「...About our plans for the summer break?」
 The holidays have just started, so it's a reasonable thing to ask about.
 st04_a05

 v03wa0215
 ワカバ「Ehehe. I can read you like a book.」
 st04_a01
 v04ce0268
 セロ「I see. Then I guess I'll have to be careful from now on.」
 v03wa0216
 ワカバ「(―Be careful? About what?)」
 Sometimes Cero says interesting things while he's grinning like that.
 v03wa0217
 ワカバ「So what're we going to do over the summer break? Hang out in the library again?」
 
 I remembered the three days I'd spent with Cero last summer.
 v03wa0218
 ワカバ「(―Well, that was fun in a different sort of way...)」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0269
 At first I just sat with Cero and sent sidelong glances his way, sometimes grabbing a few books from the shelf or fooling around.
 st04_a01
 v04ce0270
 But after I realized that was a distraction for not only Cero, but everyone else there as well, I stopped going there with him.
 
 v03wa0219
 ワカバ「(―I'd be kind of ashamed of disturbing others when they're actually using the library for its intended purpose...)」
 Even though I thought I'd be able to get absorbed in books too, I couldn't bring my typewriter and start pounding away on the keys in there.
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce0271
 And if I were writing, I'd want to be able to ask someone's advice!
 st04_a01
 v04ce0293
 Also, it would be pretty embarrassing for someone to notice if I were writing a love scene.
 v03wa0220
 ワカバ「(―If someone laughed at me, I'd probably never have the confidence to write again...)」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0273

 st04_a05
 v04ce0274
 セロ「My plans for summer break, right?」
 v03wa0222
 ワカバ「A, aah, that's right. Yeah, your plans for summer break.」
 My head was full to the brim with last year's memories.
 v03wa0223
 ワカバ「...With Coco? You're always with her, aren't you? Can't you leave her alone once in a while?」
 
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce0275
 セロ「Having Coco go to Silberg by herself is rather unreasonable.」
 v03wa0224
 ワカバ「...About the future?」
 I have to be courageous once in a while... Ah, I'm such an idiot!
 That kind of joke won't work with Cero!
 st04_a04
 v04ce0276
 セロ「Yup, you got it.」
 v03wa0225
 ワカバ「Ah, I knew you wouldn't... Wait, what's with that answer!? Do you really mean that!?」
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce0277
 セロ「Huh?」
 v03wa0226
 ワカバ「Don't say ‘Huh?’, that's my line!」
 v04ce0278
 セロ「??」
 It's hard to talk about our future when we haven't even started dating.
 Because both of us still live with our families, if they were opposed to our marriage, we couldn't very well elope.
 
 v03wa0227
 ワカバ「(―Aah, I can't take it anymore...)」
 Since I'm a writer, I always jump to conclusions too quickly.
 Doesn't Cero think this is odd at all?
 Normally, we'd start by going out, right?
 v03wa0228
 ワカバ「Hey now, calm down, Cero. This isn't just your decision. D-don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying that I don't want to. It's just, how should I say it, that is, I need time to mentally prepare myself...」
 
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce0279

 v03wa0229
 ワカバ「Well, this is a life-changing decision, you know?」
 st04_a06
 v04ce0280
 セロ「Um... I see, but... life-changing?」
 v03wa0230
 ワカバ「Don't tell me you didn't even give it any serious thought?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce0281
 セロ「Of course I did. I'm always serious.」
 Even though I wasn't angry, Cero gazed at me with a serious expression.
 
 When he met my eyes like that, I couldn't look away...
 st04_a03
 v04ce0282
 セロ「I don't foresee any problems from the outset, but I'm sure things will get more complicated later.」
 
 v03wa0231
 ワカバ「Ye, yeah. That's right.」
 That's cunning of him, suddenly using such a relaxed tone of voice.
 st04_a00
 v04ce0283
 I was at a loss for what to say or how to react.
 v03wa0232
 ワカバ「(―I'm such a bother to Cero... I know that.)」

 v03wa0234
 ワカバ「Eh, wha, what? It's about the future, right?」
 
 st04_a04
 v04ce0286

 v03wa0235
 ワカバ「...Eh? You and Coco?」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce0287
 セロ「That's right, about what I and Coco are going to do from now on.」
 So he wasn't talking about me and him... but about himself and Coco?
 v03wa0236
 ワカバ「Aha, ahahahahahahaha. So that's it!? I see, of course it is!」
 
 ...Seems like I nearly rode my train of thought off a cliff.
 v04ce0288
 セロ「And that's why this year I'm going to Silberg with Coco. So I can't spend time with you like last year...」
 
 v03wa0237
 ワカバ「Ah, wait a moment!」
 I knew the issue between him and Coco was none of my business.
 But I didn't understand it in the first place...
 v03wa0238
 「...What could it be? Hey, what is it?」
 
 Even after giving it some thought, I had no idea.
 Though normally, I would stubbornly keep on racking my brains until I came up with something―
 st04_a05
 v04ce0289
 セロ「How rare. Usually you wouldn't give up until you got it right, Wakaba.」
 v03wa0239
 ワカバ「...Ugh. If you say something like that, I'll have to try.」
 v03wa0240
 ワカバ「(―-What's with that? I was just trying to let Cero lead the conversation once in a while.)」
 st04_a04
 v04ce0290
 If I'd known this would happen, I would have thought of something before speaking up.
 st04_a00
 v04ce0291
 Okay, I'll use logic.
 st04_a01
 v04ce0292
 Cero doesn't go out much, but he came here... that means―
 v03wa0241
 ワカバ「(―Could it be that it's something really important?)」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0293
 セロ「...That's why we're going to Silberg.」
 v03wa0242
 ワカバ「(―So they're going to Silberg? That's kind of far.)」
 Who knows how many days it'd take an easy-going guy like Cero to get there?
 v03wa0243
 ワカバ「(―Though normally, you'd take the train, right? Ahahaha... ha?)」
 Wait a minute! Somehow I feel that I'm not following the conversation!
 
 v03wa0244
 ワカバ「Silberg? Did you say Silberg!?」
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce0294

 \nThat wasn't what I had wanted to say, though.
 v03wa0246
 ワカバ「Why are you going to the Silver Village... Silberg?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0295

 v03wa0249
 ワカバ「Ah, eh, um... uwaaa...」
 Why is Cero apologizing? I'm the one in the wrong here.
 
 v04ce0298
 セロ「I should have explained it more clearly. Sorry, Wakaba.」
 v03wa0250
 ワカバ「U, um... no problem. You don't have to apologize for that.」
 v03wa0251
 ワカバ「(―Why is it I'm always like this?)」
 st04_a06
 v04ce0299

 st04_a00
 v04ce0300
 セロ「...Also, the person who asked me is my patron, a doll engineer - Rein.」
 
 v03wa0252
 ワカバ「Rein?」
 I've heard that name a couple of times from Cero in the past.
  Some friend of his father's, I think, who pays Cero's schooling and living expenses.
 
 But this is the first I'd heard of him being a doll engineer.
 v03wa0253
 ワカバ「(Rein... the doll engineer?)」
 I had no evidence, but one person came to mind straight away.
 v03wa0254
 ワカバ「...Hey, Cero. Could that person possibly be...」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0301
 セロ「Hm?」
 v03wa0255
 ワカバ「...a really famous doll engineer?」
 v04ce0302

 v03wa0256
 ワカバ「How would anyone not have?!」
 Unbelievable! Cero's, Cero's patron is really... Rein, the national treasure.
 
 v03wa0257
 ワカバ「―Whoa, what's this feeling? Am I the only one who hadn't heard about this?」
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce0303
 セロ「...Um, didn't you just say ‘how would anyone not have?’...」
 v03wa0258
 ワカバ「That's not what I meant! Am I the only one who didn't know you're acquainted with someone so famous?」
 
 st04_a01
 v04ce0304
 セロ「I don't think that's the case. Until now, I don't recall saying anything about... my patron being Rein the doll engineer.」
 
 v03wa0259
 ワカバ「Eh, really? So I'm the first?」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce0305
 セロ「Yup. Nobody's asked me before, either... so it isn't such a big deal, is it?」
 
 Cero was unexpectedly humble about this.
  Isn't it something he should be proud of?
 st04_a01
 v04ce0306
 セロ「...Well, that's how it is. We'll go to Silberg at the start of the summer break.」
 v03wa0260
 ワカバ「...I see. How many days will you be away?」

 After saying goodbye to Cero now, I won't be seeing him until this day next week.
 v03wa0261
 ワカバ「(...Somehow, that feels a bit lonely...)」
 I thought I'd be able to spend some time with him, but instead I learn that he's acquainted with such a famous doll engineer.
 
 v03wa0262
 ワカバ「(―I suppose I'll spend my summer break just helping out in the store, and maybe getting a little playwriting done on the side...)」
 I need to search for actors, but I have no idea where to start.
 
 v03wa0263
 ワカバ「(―I'm sure Cero would be able to think of something.)」
 It seems I'd gotten in over my head again.
 Having to cancel my plans before I even really got started... it felt like I lost before I even got to fight the battle.
 
 v03wa0264
 ワカバ「(―That's right, how can I back down so easily!? The match has just begun!)」

 v03wa0265
 ワカバ「Souvenirs?」
 st04_a04

 セロ「Yeah. I know I shouldn't ask something like this, but it's better than getting you something you wouldn't like.」
 
 v03wa0266

 ...Ah, what am I talking about!? After saying something so weird, I―
 
 st04_a10
 v04ce0310
 セロ「Eh? U, um. I'm glad that you trust me that much, but I'm still worried I might end up choosing something weird.」
 
 
 ...That's not what Cero should be embarrassed about! Idiot! Moron!
 
 
 v03wa0267
 ワカバ「(―Gaaaah! Why don't things ever work out between us?!)」
 
 
 If there weren't anybody watching, I'd have been stamping my feet in frustration already!
 I took a few deep breaths and tried to cool my head.

 セロ「How about some photographs? They might be useful when you're writing your story.」
 
 v03wa0269
 ワカバ「...Photographs...」
 I appreciated the thought, but thinking about those sights that will be seen by Cero alone―
 v03wa0270
 ワカバ「(―Sights he'd see while I'm not there with him...)」
 v03wa0271
 ワカバ「...I would rather go together and take the pictures myself.」
 I was thinking way too negatively.
  I couldn't even accept Cero's generosity...

 v03wa0272
 ワカバ「Yeah.」
 st04_a01
 v04ce0314

 Sightseeing together with Cero... We might grow even closer before we realized it, or something like that.

 ワカバ「......」
 Ah, I definitely had said that, yes.
 ...But, what's with this development? Was I supposed to anticipate this?!
 
 v03wa0277

 v04ce0318
 セロ「Okay.」
 v03wa0278
 ワカバ「...If it's okay with you, maybe I could... you know, tag along with you to Silberg. Ahaha―」

 st04_a00

 ―This must be it! This is my chance!

 セロ「Is that really all right? Spending your savings on this―」
 
 v03wa0282
 ワカバ「I don't mind!」
 If I don't go, I'm sure I'll regret it later.
 After all, if Cero leaves for a whole week, he might meet some cute girl and fall in love with her!
 
 v03wa0283
 ワカバ「I should invest in my future too!」
 v04ce0323
 セロ「...Invest... Ah, because it might help with your story, right?」
 v03wa0284
 ワカバ「...Ye, yeah, that. That's right! Isn't it only common sense that we should experience things firsthand? Real-life experience is vitally important!」
 
 
 
 Not only that, but I couldn't just be a bystander any longer―
 st04_a01
 v04ce0324
 セロ「...Can you give me a little time to think about it?」
 v03wa0285
 ワカバ「...Tha, thanks.」
 I guess I got too excited and said too much.
 v03wa0286
 ワカバ「(―Yeah.)」
 I shouldn't forget that he has his own matters to think about, too.
 Bringing along an extra person like me, who hasn't even met the one they're going to visit, could easily be a burden.
 
 v03wa0287
 ワカバ「(Haaah. A whole week...)」
 Cero, who I see all the time, going away for that long... My heart sank just thinking about it.
 
 st04_a00

 セロ「All right, you can tag along.」
 v03wa0288
 ワカバ「...Huh?」
 st04_a01
 v04ce0326
 セロ「Would you come to Silberg with me?」
 What a quick answer!
 v03wa0289
 ワカバ「Wa, wait. Don't you need to ask Mr. Rein if it's okay?」
 st04_a05
 v04ce0327
 セロ「Hm? It's not a problem.」
 
 v03wa0290
 ワカバ「Wait, wait. Is that your decision to make?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0328
 セロ「―Yup. Rein told me it would be fine for me to bring some friends along.」
 
 v03wa0291
 ワカバ「......Really? If that's the case...」
 st04_a02
 v04ce0329
 セロ「But, Wakaba, I don't think I can bring just anyone.」
 v03wa0292
 ワカバ「Eh?」
 v04ce0330
 セロ「...Rein's travel budget is limited. That's why we can't bring just anyone along with no regard to the expense.」
 
 
 
 v04ce0331
 セロ「That money has to be repaid someday, so it's just a loan... That's why I think moderation is important.」
 
 v03wa0293
 ワカバ「Yeah.」 I couldn't argue with that.
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce0332
 セロ「But then, being too stingy and refusing those who really want to come would be rather rude, too.」
 
 As Cero said that, he turned to me with a smile, scratching his head.
 st04_a00
 v04ce0333
 セロ「...So let's go together.」
 v03wa0294
 ワカバ「...Is it really okay if I come along?」

 v03wa0295
 ワカバ「...Also?」
 st04_a00

 セロ「―Investing in your future isn't a bad idea.」
 How can he even say that with such a straight face?
 ...I felt a bit embarrassed realizing he had taken what I had said seriously.
 v03wa0296
 ワカバ「...Wait, Cero!? You're going to pay my travel expenses?」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce0336
 セロ「It might be with borrowed money, but... well, I can worry about that when the time comes.」
 
 v03wa0297
 ワカバ「No, no! I insisted on coming along, so you can't do that! Wouldn't it be weird if I weren't the one paying!?」
 
 
 v04ce0337
 セロ「Not at all.」
 v03wa0298
 ワカバ「Why not!?」
 v04ce0338
 セロ「That's because I came here to invite you to come with me, Wakaba.」
 ...Could he have...
  Is that why he came to talk to me?
 v03wa0299
 ワカバ「But, but! Why were you talking about getting me a souvenir?」
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce0339
 セロ「That's because, when I brought it up... You didn't really seem like you wanted to go, so I thought you weren't interested.」
 
 v03wa0300
 ワカバ「Ah, that's because you said you were going on a trip... and...」
 I never would have imagined he actually came here to invite me.
 st04_a00
 v04ce0340
 セロ「...? Anyway, now that I understand your feelings, I'm glad I came to invite you.」

 Awesome! This year's summer break is gonna be the best!

 In my excitement, I had forgotten to ask Cero about an important matter.
 That matter was, who else would be joining us on our journey?
 Has he already invited anyone, or is he planning to invite someone else?
 I could just phone him and ask, but it was hard to find the opportunity to, because―

 Light is in the living room. That's the main obstacle.
 v03wa0311
 ワカバ「(―I wonder if Cero invited Light?)」
 It was Light who told me Cero had come to visit, so Cero might have asked him beforehand if he wanted to go to Silberg too.
 
 But Light didn't seem to be acting any differently from usual, and he hadn't said anything about it to me either.
 
 
 
 black450
 v03wa0312
 ワカバ「(―I guess he hasn't heard?)」
 Or has he not said anything because he doesn't know whether I was invited too?

 There's an 80% chance that he doesn't know I've been invited, but if I'm not careful...

 Were he to join us, the extra cost would be a burden to Cero in the future.

 That's right! Light has to stay in the store to help out anyway.

 She'll yell at me over stuff that happened ages ago. Why should I have to apologize?

 st02_a10

 Coco has the habit of shortening long names a little from either the front or the back.
 Additionally, she seems to have a rule about shortening male names from the back, and female names from the front.

 The day I went to invite Wakaba, I ran into Light before I saw her.
 But it seemed like he was busy working in the store, so I invited Wakaba first.
 
 After that, I was thinking of having Wakaba ask Light whether he wanted to join us or not, but―

 It seems like before I had the chance, he'd already talked to Coco about it.

 Though we'd walked at a relaxed pace while chatting, we arrived at the station five minutes ahead of schedule.
 Normally, Wakaba would come running out to meet us, looking fed up with waiting so long.

 How unusual. I couldn't see her anywhere.
 v04ce0354
 セロ「Did she need to buy something?」
 There's time to spare between the time we planned to meet and the departure time of our train, so I guess it's not a problem.
 If it gets to be too close, I could call her from the phone booth nearby... her house is close enough to run there, too.

 Coco and I both waved to her as she walked in and out of the shadows of the buildings on the street towards us.
 ...As well as the backpack on her shoulders, she was carrying luggage in both hands, so she walked over to join us without waving back.

 Inside the notebook Coco is always scribbling in, fixed in place with rubber bands, is a leaflet she's really proud of.

 Firstly, from Light's point of view.

 It's Wakaba's turn next.
 From her point of view, she probably couldn't decide whether to ask me whether Light was coming with us or ask her brother directly.

 In this situation, if I were to point out who was in the wrong― ...it would probably be Wakaba, but I don't have the heart to blame her.

 I pulled Light away from Wakaba, and whispered in his ear.
 v04ce0401

 While Coco and Light were chatting in the seat across from us, Wakaba suddenly spoke up.
 
 
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa0375
 ワカバ「...Hey, Cero. There's something I haven't told you.」
 Well, if she says something like that, I guess I'm supposed to inquire further.
 v04ce0408
 セロ「What is it?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0376
 ワカバ「Well, it's about the theater festival...」
 v04ce0409
 セロ「Theater festival? Oh, the one in Moosgrun.」
 
 She must mean the local theater festival that's going to be held two months from now.
 st03_a06
 v03wa0377
 ワカバ「...Yeah. I actually submitted my entry for it already.」
 v04ce0410
 セロ「Entry?」
 She's taking part in the theater festival?
 Huh... I didn't know she was interested in that sort of thing.
 st03_a02
 v03wa0378
 ワカバ「I want to try it out onstage this time.」
 v04ce0411
 セロ「Try it out... onstage?」
 st03_a03
 v03wa0379
 ワカバ「Y, yeah.」
 v04ce0412
 セロ「...I see...」
 Wakaba wants to perform onstage?
 I'm not sure I'm understanding her correctly, but that's what she meant, right?
 v04ce0413
 セロ「But what do you want to do on the stage? A recitation, you mean?」
 
 st03_a04
 v03wa0380
 ワカバ「No, it's theater.」
 v04ce0414
 セロ「A one-woman play? You?」
 
 st03_a05
 v03wa0381
 ワカバ「Huh? Me? No, I'm the one who wrote the play.」
 
 v04ce0415
 セロ「Ah, I see. Of course. You're the playwright, Wakaba.」
 So at the theater festival, Wakaba's going to make her debut as a playwright.
  She almost seems like a pro already.
 v04ce0416
 セロ「...That's really great, Wakaba. The story you wrote is going to become a real play.」
 st03_a12
 v03wa0382
 ワカバ「Ehehe.」
 As Wakaba grew embarrassed, I was able to relax a little.
 Even so, I'm still a bit anxious somehow.
 v04ce0417
 セロ「So what kind of play is it? Is it an original story?」
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa0383
 ワカバ「...Hmm, well, it is sort of original... hmm, I wonder... how should I put it?」
 
 v04ce0418
 セロ「What's it about?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa0384
 ワカバ「It's the one I showed you a while ago.」
 It's original, and I've seen it before?
 v04ce0419
 セロ「Er, the one you showed me a bit of before... the one with Chiro?」
 st03_a11
 v03wa0385
 ワカバ「T, that's wrong! It's not that one! I'd never use that! Never!」
 
 
 
 Wakaba blushed as she denied it with extreme vehemence. Though the force of her denial piqued my curiosity a little, I decided not to press the matter.
 
 But if it wasn't that one, the other was―
 v04ce0420
 セロ「Then you mean your new take on ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ right?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa0386
 ワカバ「Yup, that's the one.」
 v04ce0421
 セロ「...Ah, I see now.」
 Back when she'd shown it to me, it was still in the plot outline stage.
 The fact that it's based on ‘The Angel's Guidance’ makes it not really an original... is that what she meant?
 
 
 v04ce0422
 セロ「Would one call it ‘inspired by’? An homage? Which is it?」
 
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa0387
 ワカバ「It's not like I'm plagiarizing!」
 v04ce0423
 セロ「That's not what I meant, I'm just wondering... what you'd call it.」
 st03_a03
 v03wa0388
 ワカバ「U, um. It came to me in a dream, so... inspired, I guess?」
 v03wa0389
 ワカバ「...Ah, but won't everyone say it's an homage?」
 
 v04ce0424
 セロ「Hmm. But the plot goes in a different direction from history and the original play... so what would that make it, then?」
 
 We both kept thinking.
 I couldn't come to a conclusion, since I hadn't seen the finished work.

 v04ce0426
 セロ「I see. Then just the plot summary would be fine.」
 st03_a00
 v03wa0391
 ワカバ「I've been really busy, so I haven't added much to it since then... is it okay?」
 v04ce0427
 セロ「So you mean, the script itself aside... you haven't even done an outline?」
 st03_a07
 v03wa0392
 ワカバ「Of course not! It's not that easy to write, you know. I'm going to be doing research at Mr. Rein's place, too.」
 
 
 v04ce0428
 セロ「So you say, but you've already entered it in the festival... will you finish in time?」
 st03_a01
 v03wa0393
 ワカバ「...I guess.」
 When she answered me in that oddly relaxed tone, I too felt relieved.
 ...But I mustn't. I've lost count of how many failures I've had to experience just because I was tricked by that smiling face.
 v04ce0429
 セロ「Think carefully about this, Wakaba. Calmly.」
 st03_a00
 v03wa0394
 ワカバ「That's what I'd been planning to do... do I look like I'm anxious?」
 v04ce0430
 セロ「...You do look calm, at that.」
 I'm the one who's anxious.
 v04ce0431
 セロ「Anyway, if you don't finish up your outline quickly...」

 ワカバ「Hey, settle down!」
 After spending the night in La Renoncule, we'd taken a clattering mountain train early the next morning, and in two hours, we'd arrived at our destination - Silberg.
 
 
 v03wa0397
 ワカバ「(―The scenery really is beautiful...)」
 But, is it just my imagination, or is my eyesight a bit fuzzy?
 v03wa0398
 ワカバ「(―This sucks, it's really blurry...)」
 I kept rubbing my eyes, but in the end I had no choice but to close them.
 st04_a00
 v04ce0434
 セロ「What's wrong, Wakaba?」
 v03wa0399
 ワカバ「Ahaha. It seems like I didn't get enough sleep.」
 When we were staying in La Renoncule, I had some things on my mind.
 That's because this trip was originally planned to be just Cero, Coco and me.
 v03wa0400
 ワカバ「(―There's no way we can all sleep in one room.)」
 But Cero was unexpectedly thoughtful; he'd already booked two rooms before our departure.
 v03wa0401
 ワカバ「(―Thanks to that, adding Light isn't that big of a deal.)」
 It had still ruined my fantasy quite nicely. But even if I couldn't hang out alone with Cero like I had hoped, sleeping in the room next to his... was a little exciting.
 
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce0435
 セロ「Could it be because you were busy writing the outline?」
 v03wa0402
 ワカバ「Ah, t-that's right!」
 st04_a04
 v04ce0436
 セロ「...Seems like it's not coming along very fast.」
 v03wa0403
 ワカバ「(―Half right!)」
 As he had deduced, I dove into it with the mindset of a pro, all fired up to write, write, write!
 
 v03wa0404
 ワカバ「(―If only Light hadn't been talking in his sleep and distracting me...)」
 I whirled to the side to face my brother, who'd so casually invited himself along on this tri― huh, he's gone?
 ...Just as I thought that, I spotted him chatting with Coco beside the lake.
 v03wa0405
 ワカバ「Light, what are you doing over there!?」
 face05_a00
 v05li0223
 ライト「Don't mind me, I'm being a good boy!」
 
 
 Impossible. As long as he's still Light, there's no way.
 He's never once been ‘a good boy’ up until now, so how can anyone trust him?
 
 v05li0224
 That kid is the sort who panics whenever something goes amiss, and never learns from his past mistakes.
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce0437
 That's why he would always make the same mistakes over again, leaving Mom and me to sigh.
 v03wa0406
 ワカバ「(―A-ah. How did my brother end up like this?)」
 When he was little, he used to call me ‘Big Sis, Big Sis’ so politely, and listen to me obediently.
 
 v03wa0407
 ワカバ「(―He was so cute back then.)」
 Since then, he's grown to be more and more of a brat. Whenever Light did something wrong, I got punished too, but if I tried to use that to discipline him―
 
 
 v05li0225
 ライト「What's with you? You're not Mom, you know!」
 It's hard for me to bear when he says something impertinent like that.
 He's even got stronger lately, so all of our tussles end in a tie.
 st03_c07
 v03wa0408
 ワカバ「(―And even worse, he's been going easy on me...)」
 The worst part of all is that when I take him on seriously, he can handle me without breaking a sweat.
 That pisses me off the most.
 v03wa0409
 ワカバ「(―Why? I was the one who stood up for you when you used to wet your bed.)」
 Not to mention whenever I'd gotten more candies than him and shared mine, and that time when he broke a bunch of stuff in the store, too.
 v04ce0438
 セロ「...Hey, Wakaba.」
 I took all the blame from everyone. The least that brat could do is show some gratitude.
 st03_c02
 v03wa0410
 ワカバ「(―But instead, he just resumes his mischief again the next day.)」
 I wonder when he'll finally shape up and give me the chance to relax.
 st04_a05
 v04ce0439

 This place isn't Moosgrun; it's the first time we've ever been here.
  How could he just walk off alone like that?!
 st04_a00
 v04ce0441
 セロ「Seems like he and Coco wanted to go find Rein's house.」
 v03wa0413
 ワカバ「Why would he want to find it? What does he plan to do there? And what about us? How do we find each other again?」
 
 
 v04ce0442
 セロ「...I seem to recall it's nearby, so I think it's fine even if we explore a little ourselves.」
 v03wa0414
 ワカバ「What if they can't find it? They don't know Mr. Rein's phone number like we do, right?」
 
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce0443
 セロ「...You're right.」
 v03wa0415
 ワカバ「Honestly! How can you say that when you're the leader!?」
 
 Cero looked troubled as I scolded him.
 st04_a01
 v04ce0444
 セロ「...Well, since I'm sure it's around here somewhere, things will work out somehow,」 he said optimistically.
 
 v03wa0416
 ワカバ「(―Whoa, he's so naive!)」
 Why are boys always like this? They never plan ahead and just assume everything will work out in the end.
 
 v03wa0417

 st04_a05
 v04ce0445

 v04ce0447
 セロ「I'm fine, I'm fine.」
 v03wa0420

 With a sigh, I followed behind him.

 ワカバ「Is it just my imagination, or does this look just the same as where we just were?」

 セロ「Nope. I don't think it's your imagination. It's because the lake is so big.」

 After walking for twenty minutes over high ground and low, the vista of the lake still hasn't changed.
 
 v03wa0425
 ワカバ「(―Of course I know how big the lake is...)」
 At this rate, I wonder when we'll actually reach Mr. Rein's house.
 Also, those two going on ahead of us is making me anxious.

 st04_a05

 v03wa0428
 ワカバ「Promise?」
 st04_a01
 v04ce0452
 セロ「...Yup. He promised me that he'd take care of Coco. That's why they went together.」
 
 Cero is really too nice of a guy. No matter how I think of it, that was just an excuse to play together off on their own.
 
 v03wa0429
 ワカバ「Mr. Rein's house... will we really be able to find it?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce0453
 セロ「This isn't that big of a village, so I think we'll manage.」
 v03wa0430
 ワカバ「But his house is pretty far from the residential area, isn't it?」
 According to the map that he showed me before we started walking, Mr. Rein's house is located far away from the residential area.
 
 v04ce0454
 セロ「Well, it's quite a unique house, after all. I'm sure someone can give us directions to it.」
 
 v03wa0431
 ワカバ「...I guess. That is, if we can find that someone.」
 It's incredibly quiet around here, we're getting further from the residential area, and we've yet to bump into another person.
 
 At this rate, we'll keep wandering around forever.
 
 
 v03wa0432
 ワカバ「(―Oh well, at least it isn't just me.)」
 If I were all alone in a unfamiliar place, even I would―
 v03wa0433
 ワカバ「...Eh, huh? Wait, that's right!」
 st04_a05
 v04ce0455

 v03wa0434
 ワカバ「N, nothing! It's nothing.」
 
 It took me long enough, but I finally realized it.

 I'm alone with Cero, aren't I?!
 st04_a00

 セロ「Even though Moosgrun's a nice town, Silberg is pretty nice too, isn't it?」
 v03wa0437

 I couldn't help but wonder why he'd started talking all of a sudden.
 st04_a00
 v04ce0458
 セロ「Even though it's kind of out of the way, living in a mountain village like this might not be bad.」

 st04_a01
 v04ce0459
 セロ「...Yeah. It might suit a writer like you, too.」
 One of us is a reader, the other a writer. We can converse easily with each other thanks to our similar passions.
 
 v03wa0439
 ワカバ「(―Ah, but...)」
 After Cero achieves his dream of becoming a historian, he might become a writer like me.
 
 v03wa0440
 ワカバ「(―Then we would be in the same profession!)」
 If either of us got stuck while writing, we could ask the other for advice... But if we both ran out of ideas, that would be a problem.
 
 v03wa0441
 ワカバ「(―We might close ourselves up in our room and never come out.)」
 And then, through its walls, moaning would be heard―

  I've gone too far with my fantasy.

 \nCero's words made my heart pound.
 v03wa0445
 ワカバ「...Are you serious?」
 v04ce0462
 セロ「It's just... a possibility.」
 Even though Cero's tone of voice was light-hearted, his eyes were serious.
 If that's why he wanted me to come to Silberg with him―
 Could this be... no, this must be... a proposal?
 「―W, wait. This is so sudden, I'm not ready yet...」
 「―That's impossible, since I live with my family...」
 v03wa0446

 The thought of living with Cero was tempting, but it's difficult to choose him over Mom and Light.

 v03wa0447
 ワカバ「(―Why is he laughing? I'm being serious here!)」
 
 Even I want to leave home and be independent someday.
  I'll earn money as a novelist, and then support my family with it.
 That's why, if he's talking about the distant future―
 v03wa0448

 v03wa0451

 If I were to live with Cero, of course Coco would be there too.
  It hadn't even occurred to me earlier―

 It's not that I have any problem with such a straightforward confession, but I can't help but be nervous.

 The conversation was about Cero wanting to live in Silberg, and then he asked me if I'd like to as well... so I had thought.
 
 But then Coco's name appeared suddenly out of nowhere. I couldn't make anything out of this.

 I never thought that Cero, whose only talent is history, would have been considering such a thing.
 Compared to him, I'm still a child.
 Even though I'm free to do what I want to do, I don't have even one thing to show for it.
 
 ...At this rate, I'll lose to Cero.

 In truth, I've already been utterly defeated.

 I tried to catch up to him as I said that, but just when I was near him...

 It seemed like she was about to go on, but instead she went suddenly silent.

 ...Ah. I thought that might have been it.

 ...As far as I could tell, the girl we met had just been a normal girl.
 v03wa0498
 ワカバ「Belle is a Sister. Since Mr. Rein is her creator, it isn't strange that she claims to be his daughter.」

 st03_a03
 v03wa0500
 ワカバ「Sheesh. Didn't you notice that she has that symbolic wing?」
 v04ce0528

 Go easy on me. It's not like my speciality is the history of dolls.
 st03_a00
 v03wa0502
 ワカバ「But I suppose it's understandable. Mr. Rein never told you about Belle, did he?」
 
 v04ce0530
 セロ「Yup. What those children said earlier was the first I'd heard of her.」
 v03wa0503
 ワカバ「In addition, you're a lot more used to the sight of Coco.」
 v04ce0531
 セロ「What do you mean by that?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0504
 ワカバ「Well, even though Coco is such an antique-model Sister, she doesn't have any wings.」
 
 
 v03wa0505
 ワカバ「―After living with Coco for such a long period of time, you probably forgot that some Sisters do have wings.」
 
 
 
 Now that she puts it that way, she's probably right.
 In Coco's back, there's a big key rather than any wings.
 It might resemble a wing if you look at it the right way, but to me it's just something that needs winding up on occasion.
 
 
 
 bg07a01
 v04ce0532
 セロ「(―But why does Belle have a wing?)」
 It's true that antique dolls possess wings on their back.
 
 
 But that tradition has been out of fashion for over a century.
 If Rein is the one who created her, the time period doesn't match up.
 
 As I was thinking about that and calculating the years in my head, Belle returned.

 In the past, Wakaba came to my house and made me something called a ‘foolproof curry’ once.
 
 ...I hadn't been able to stop her from pouring milk into it as a secret ingredient, as she said ‘it'll go to waste if I don't.’
 
 The result wasn't a complete failure, but if the meat and vegetables were sliced into smaller pieces, it would have tasted better.

 Though at first I was worried about cooking together with them since we've just met, I seemed to be getting along with them well.
 
 Now that we've finished preparing lunch, we are waiting for my father to finish his discussion.

 I had thought so too.

 st05_a05

 st05_a05

 v01be0031
 ベル「I'm really happy that we met.」
 Even though I thought she would look more like an elder sister, in reality Coco was small and cute. \n...I have to keep that misunderstanding regarding Wakaba and Coco a secret, too.

 st05_a05
 v05li0311
 ライト「Eh?」
 Light's mind went blank with confusion.
 v01be0033
 ベル「Coco refers to me as ‘Fa-’ when she calls for me.」
 Back when we were cooking in the kitchen, when something happened,
 v02co1316
 ココ「Fa-?」 she would say, while tugging at my overalls...
 
 
 At first I thought it was her word for ‘hey’ or something―
 v01be0034

 st05_a00

 st05_a05

 Indeed, just as Light said, Coco is also an elder sister to him.
 face02_b07

 Coco put her hands on her hips and assumed a proud stance.
 v01be0040

 st05_a01
 v05li0320
 ライト「...See that thing hanging around Coco's neck? Do you have something like that, Fa?」
 
 At Coco's chest, where Light was pointing, hung a transparent glass bottle. Inside it, there was a rainbow of colorful gems.
 
 v01be0042
 ベル「...Are you talking about those Drops?」
 
 
 st05_a00
 v05li0321
 ライト「That's right. They're something very important to a Sister, right?」
 
 
 v01be0043

 v05li0322
 ライト「When I first met Coco, Uncle Cero told me that. He said I mustn't play with the stones inside that bottle.」
 
 v01be0044

 st05_a05
 v05li0323

 To demonstrate it to Light, I placed both of my hands atop my chest.
 st05_a00
 v05li0324
 ライト「Oh, I see.」
 My Drops are stored near where a human's heart would be.
 
 
 v01be0046
 ベル「I can't take them out to show you, but they're a different type of Drops compared to Coco's.」
 
 
 The Drops Coco possess are various size and colors, and mine― are just round objects of similar size.
 
 v01be0047
 ベル「...Ah, that's right. Inside my room, there are some spare Drops. Would you like to see them?」

 I was happy that both of them were smiling, so I wanted to do that for them. \n...But as I was heading inside, I bumped into Cero at the entrance.

 v01be0050

 Even though I said that with a straight face, I was still slightly embarrassed by it.
 v04ce0559
 セロ「Coco did? ...But why would she do that...?」
 
 First I, then Light, and now Cero had frowned in confusion over Coco's actions. \nDespite that, he didn't question Coco about it.
 
 
 st04_a04
 v04ce0560
 セロ「Doesn't a nickname like that bother you?」 he asked me instead with a smile.
 
 v01be0051

 I wasn't lying. In fact, I've started to feel that it suits me.

 v01be0052
 ベル「It's, it's fine. You don't have to be that formal.」
 It wasn't just Cero, I wasn't used to people speaking to me that politely. Even as the village's children reach adulthood, they still call me ‘Belle’ like before. The only person who won't use my name―
 
 
 
 v01be0053
 ベル「(―Is my father...)」
 As I thought about that,
 v03wa0557
 ワカバ「...Belle, where are you-!? If you can hear me, please answer-!」 I heard a loud voice.
 
 
 Of course, the one calling for me wasn't my father, but Wakaba.
 v01be0054

 v03wa0558
 ワカバ「Ah, don't move! I'll be right there!」

 face04_a10

 Faced with Wakaba, standing on tiptoe as she tried to rub Cero's forehead better, he reassured her even though he looked like he was on the verge of tears from the pain.

 Before I finished my explanation, I was dragged back inside the house by Light. \nWhile outside, Wakaba―

 The weather was unusually nice today, so we had our lunch out in the open.

 Wakaba and I arranged the cutlery, and put a tablecloth over the round wooden table on the porch.
 
 After that, we gathered together and Belle fetched Rein from his room.
 Even though Light had only made simple dishes like curry and ham sandwiches, there were many dishes to choose from, so it was rather well received.
 
 
 It's just that, as Wakaba was trying the curry,
 st03_a00
 v03wa0567

 she had said while staring me with a mysterious glare.

 st11_a02
 v11re0077
 レイン「So, how is Coco worrying you?」
  in a kind voice.
 v04ce0576
 セロ「...It's a bit difficult to say...」
 Would it be unwise to learn a bit about doll engineering before I become a true historian?
 
 I quickly recounted to Rein the discussion I'd had with Wakaba before coming here.
 
 st11_a07

 v04ce0577

 st11_a00

 v04ce0581

 st11_a02

 「...It's Wakaba. I'm sure she can do it.」
 v04ce0582

 Even though I'm perhaps biased because Wakaba is my friend, I truly believe she has the potential to achieve her dreams.

 レイン「Indeed, no? Wakaba is a child who can do anything, just like you. ...even I seem to have that impression.」
 
 v04ce0583

 Nothing is easy from the start - that's a fact for any kind of endeavor.
 But as long as you don't lose your passion and keep working hard, there will always be a way.

 レイン「Mmm. Perhaps it's a bit harsh, I've decided to test Wakaba.」
 
 v04ce0584

 I forced a smile as a feeling of anxiety overcame me.
  What in the world did Wakaba say to Rein...
 st11_a02
 v11re0089
 レイン「In two months time, there is going to be a theater festival in Moosgrun, right?」
 v04ce0585
 セロ「Ah, yes... wait, you mean...!?」
 So Wakaba had told him about her brash entry to the theater festival that she'd told me on the way here from La Renoncule.
 
 v11re0090
 レイン「Yes. I'm sure you are already aware, but Wakaba wishes to prove herself at the theater festival.」
 v04ce0586
 セロ「I do know that... but have you heard the details?」
 st11_a05
 v11re0091

 v04ce0587
 セロ「Th, that's right. But...」
 st11_a04
 v11re0092
 レイン「In addition, the play she's writing is based on the hidden truth of ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ audaciously portraying the betrayer, Ein, as a good person... What an unexpected twist.」
 
 
 It seems that Wakaba had told him everything.
 v04ce0588
 セロ「So, the favor Wakaba asked of you was...」
 st11_a05
 v11re0093
 レイン「In short, she requested that I financially sponsor her. That's what we spoke about interview before lunch, after you left the room.」
 
 v04ce0589
 セロ「...As I thought...」
 It was only to be expected of her, but should I think of it as unreasonable, or just too tactless?
  It's so like Wakaba to take such a bold approach after making her decision.
 v04ce0590
 セロ「So, did you agree to it?」
 st11_a01
 v11re0094
 レイン「...I gave her a few conditions.」
 Rein glanced at me with his narrowed eyes, and nodded a few times.
 st11_a00
 v11re0095
 レイン「First, I asked Wakaba to find the actors herself.」
 v11re0096
 レイン「―When I said that, she immediately suggested my daughter as a candidate.」
 v04ce0591
 セロ「Belle?」
 v11re0097
 レイン「To play the role of the Sister in The Angel's Guidance.」
 
 
 st11_a04
 v11re0098
 レイン「―That's what she said. I was personally fine with it, but who knows how Belle will feel? ‘If you want my daughter to perform, ask her yourself.’ ...That's what I said.」
 
 v04ce0592
 セロ「So that's the reason...」
 That's why Wakaba was in such a hurry to talk to Belle on the porch earlier.
 v04ce0593
 セロ「...Huh, Rein? That wasn't the only condition for your sponsorship, was it?」
 
 
 st11_a00
 v11re0099
 レイン「Ah, there are other conditions I haven't spoken of yet. That's why I called you here. ...So that you can tell her about them later.」
 
 v04ce0594
 セロ「I don't mind, but...」
 st11_a01
 v11re0100
 レイン「Relax. They're not anything too difficult, so calm down.」
 Rein sat up straight on his chair, and looked me in the eye once again.
 st11_a02
 v11re0101
 レイン「What I heard from Wakaba was that her script is not actually an adaptation of ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ but rather something she wishes to remain true to history.」
 
 
 v11re0102
 レイン「―If that's the case, she needs suitable evidence to prove Ein's innocence, right?」
 v04ce0595
 セロ「That's true.」
 st11_a00
 v11re0103
 レイン「So that's why, as Wakaba is researching what happened in the past, she'll need an assistant.」
 
 v04ce0596
 セロ「...And that will be me?」
 Even though I knew the answer, I still asked to be sure.
 st11_a01
 v11re0104
 レイン「Well, even if I don't specify so, it should be obvious. Hohoho.」
 
 v04ce0597
 セロ「(―Whoa, the way he laughs is as if it were someone else's business.)」
 st11_a00
 v11re0105
 レイン「I have two more conditions. The first one is to travel to the location where the story began, Weiss― and see for yourself the White City and the Castle of Dornstein.」
 st11_a05
 v11re0106
 レイン「―The second condition is to gather all the actors yourselves. If you fulfill these conditions, I'll sponsor the performance. Is that within your means?」
 
 v04ce0598
 セロ「...How should I say it?」
 Visiting the actual setting, and gathering the actors ourselves.
  These are sensible enough conditions that Rein needn't have set in stone, but the latter might not be so easy.
 Even though the theater festival has no rules concerning whether the actors are amateurs or professionals, those who have performed recently have set quite a high standard.
 If all the actors we gather are all amateurs, and we put them into Wakaba's problematic scenario...
  Then we can probably expect our performance to be roundly panned.
 Still...
 v04ce0599
 セロ「...Anyway, we won't know until we try.」
 st11_a01
 v11re0107

 Rein stood up and smiled, satisfied.

 After considering it for a while, I couldn't find any reason to object.
 Even for me, traveling to a place I've never been before like the White City is quite a temptation.

 st01_c06

 Even though Belle said that, her room was a lot neater than mine.
  ...Well, it was more like she didn't have any unnecessary possessions.
 v03wa0569
 ワカバ「I'm sorry for asking to speak with you so suddenly.」
 st01_c01
 v01be0062
 ベル「...Ah, please have a seat if you would like.」
 v03wa0570
 ワカバ「Thank you!」
 As I sat down, I glanced around the room once again.
 v03wa0571
 ワカバ「Is this your own room?」
 st01_c00
 v01be0063
 ベル「Yes. There are other spare rooms, but only I and my father live here.」
 v03wa0572
 ワカバ「How nice to have such a large room. It's only recently that I got my own room.」
 st01_c05
 v01be0064

 v03wa0573
 ワカバ「...I was sharing one with Light. Man, it was really a pain having that brat messing up my stuff and dropping crumbs everywhere as he snacked.」
 
 
 
 st01_c01
 v01be0065
 ベル「Ufufu. It sounds kind of fun to me.」
 v03wa0574
 ワカバ「There's no way I'd find that fun. If you lived with that brat for three... no, I'm sure that you couldn't even handle one day with him.」
 
 Man, what am I doing talking about my experiences to someone whom they're of no concern to?
 st01_c06
 v01be0066
 ベル「Still, I'm quite envious of people who have siblings.」
 v03wa0575
 ワカバ「...Really?」
 st01_c03
 v01be0067
 ベル「Yes. Even though the children in this village are like siblings to me...」
 As Belle spoke, as if suddenly overcome by a memory, she shook her head and her words trailed off.
 
 v03wa0576
 ワカバ「What's wrong?」
 st01_c04
 v01be0068
 ベル「No, it's nothing. That aside, what is it that you wished to ask of me?」
 v03wa0577
 ワカバ「...Ah, u-um.」
 st01_c00
 Originally, I wanted to talk to Belle before lunch, but it seemed like it had been a bad time, so I had put it off until now.
 
 v03wa0578
 ワカバ「(―Do you want to perform in the theater festival?)」
 I've already received permission from Rein, now all I have to do is convince Belle!
 
 ...But actually broaching the subject isn't so easy.
 v03wa0579
 ワカバ「Hey, Belle, do you like sightseeing?」
 st01_c05
 v01be0069
 ベル「Sightseeing?」
 v03wa0580
 ワカバ「That's right. You've traveled before, haven't you?」
 st01_c04
 v01be0070
 ベル「...I never have, so I don't really understand.」
 v03wa0581
 ワカバ「(―Oh, man.)」
  My lead-in had been a failure.
 st01_c01
 v01be0071
 ベル「...But, it does seem fun, so I don't think I would dislike it.」
 v03wa0582
 ワカバ「Yeah, it's really fun. New places lead to new discoveries, and just looking around is exciting. And you can find inspiration for writing, too!」
 
 
 st01_c06
 v01be0072
 ベル「When I look at you, I can somehow understand that.」
 v03wa0583
 ワカバ「Ah, really? Ehehe.」
 
 Soothed by Belle's smile, I calmed down, but I didn't come here just to chat with her.
 
 At times like these, taking the initiative is important!
 I have to get straight to the point, straight to the point!
 v03wa0584
 ワカバ「Then, Belle! I'll be frank now.」
 
 st01_c08

 ベル「Y, yes?」
 v03wa0585
 ワカバ「I, I want... you.」
 st01_c04
 v01be0074
 ベル「...Um...」
 I couldn't read Belle's expression. I didn't know what to do next.
 But there had been a one-liner like this in a novel I'd read in the past, and it had worked!
 
 st01_c03
 v01be0075

 v03wa0586

 v03wa0588
 ワカバ「Yup yup.」
 st01_c03
 v01be0078
 ベル「I don't hate you, Wakaba. In fact, I think you're a wonderful person. But I want to... continue living together with my father. I'm sorry, I couldn't impose upon your family like that...」
 
 
 v03wa0589
 ワカバ「(―What's with that reaction?)」
 Why did she say something about living together, and imposing upon―
 v03wa0590
 ワカバ「N, no, wait, it's a misunderstanding! I haven't finished explaining yet!」
 
 After psyching myself up, I'd asked her straight out without even explaining anything!
 v03wa0591
 ワカバ「It's not like I'm trying to do anything to you! I don't hate you either, Belle, but that's... huh?」
 
 Somehow, even I've gotten mixed up.
  I took a deep breath to calm myself, and recovered my composure.
 v03wa0592
 ワカバ「Er, please forget everything I said earlier.」
 st01_c03
 v01be0079
 ベル「...O, okay.」
 v03wa0593
 ワカバ「Recently the town we live in, Moosgrun, announced a theater festival. Even though I've already placed my entry for it, I haven't found any actors yet.」
 
 
 st01_c05
 v01be0080
 ベル「...I see.」
 v03wa0594
 ワカバ「So if it's okay with you... actually, there's a role that can't be played by anyone other than you, I really want you to perform no matter what, what do you think?」
 
 The appearance of the Sister in The Angel's Guidance 
 
 has been widely speculated about, but no one can say for sure how she really looked.
 But, the image of the ‘angel’ that I'm imagining 
 
 is that of an antique doll with wings.
  I think that it's the perfect role for Belle!
 v01be0081
 ベル「Me, performing on stage...?」
 v03wa0595
 ワカバ「That's right.」
 st01_c04
 v01be0082
 ベル「It's a theater festival, right? I don't have any experience with acting...」
 
 v03wa0596
 ワカバ「Have you ever played ‘princess’ with the children before?」
 st01_c05
 v01be0083
 ベル「I have, but...」
 v03wa0597
 ワカバ「Then that's more than enough! You have potential! You just have to practice!」
 
 
 st01_c08
 v01be0084
 ベル「Ah, b, but, I don't know what kind of character I'm portraying, or what I should do...」
 v03wa0598
 ワカバ「The role of a Sister standing alongside the princess.」
 
 
 st01_c05
 v01be0085
 ベル「So I just have to stand there?」
 v03wa0599
 ワカバ「Of course not just that...」
 Belle really is pretty naive... Was she born like that?
 v03wa0600
 ワカバ「I haven't finished my script yet, so I'll summarize it for you. I want you to play the role of the Sister who lives alongside the princess... a Sister who is skilled at singing.」
 
 
 
 
 
 
 v01be0086
 ベル「...Singing?」
 v03wa0601
 ワカバ「That's right! Belle, you love singing, right?」
 
 I made use of the information ‘Belle enjoys singing’ that Rein had given me during our conversation.
 
 st01_c04
 v01be0087
 ベル「...I do... like it.」
 v03wa0602
 ワカバ「Then you're qualified!」
 st01_c08
 v01be0088
 ベル「Huh? Why am I qualified just because I like singing?」
 v03wa0603
 ワカバ「In my play, I've already written the scene of the Sister singing. Ah, I didn't write it because I was hoping that you would agree to perform, I planned on it since the beginning.」
 
 
 
 
 v03wa0604
 ワカバ「―If you decide to accept the role, we'll only have to search for an actress for the role of the princess! So, what do you think?」
 
 
 Right now I'd just like her to promise to join the troupe. I'll explain the details to her later.
 Since I really want this angel to perform as the play's central character!
 st01_c10
 v01be0089
 ベル「...My role is to stay by the princess and sing...」
 Upon the lips of her slightly bowed head, I saw the flicker of a smile.
  Now is the moment to press her further!
 v03wa0605
 ワカバ「That's right! You don't even have to audition for it! You're guaranteed the role!」
 
 
 st01_c00
 v01be0090
 ベル「...」
 Under my encouragement, Belle slowly lifted her head.
  She nodded slightly, and I listened in anticipation for her response―
 st01_c04
 v01be0091
 ベル「...This is so sudden, can you give me some time to think about it?」
  and she replied, making my shoulders drop.
 
 For a moment, I almost blurted out a question like ‘why not?’, but I knew that would be counterproductive, so I kept it to myself.
 
 Just as Cero had said on the train, it's difficult for people to accept things so hastily.
 
 st01_c03
 v01be0092
 ベル「I'm sorry. Even though you specifically invited me...」
 v03wa0606
 ワカバ「...Ah, it's okay. I think your reaction is quite normal.」
 st01_c07
 v01be0093
 ベル「......」
 v03wa0607
 ワカバ「Please think about it. I don't want to force you, but... I haven't given up! Anyway, that's all for today. See you!」
 
 
 st01_c05

 ベル「O, okay.」
 black450
 After exiting the room, I sighed heavily.
 v03wa0608
 ワカバ「(―A-ah. Dealing with people isn't easy...)」
 Still, I had the impression Belle had been willing to accept.
 But she had hesitated because something was bothering her.
 ...That's how it looked to me.

 With the map booklet from the shelf in my hands, I confirmed the location of that town south-east of Silberg.
 I had heard it would take a day's train ride to return home, if I were to follow Cero and his friends there.
 v01be0096
 ベル「(―I wonder what kind of play it is?)」
 When Wakaba was explaining it to me, I hadn't gotten a very good impression, since she was rushed and didn't go into detail.
 v01be0097
 ベル「...A Sister standing beside the princess.」
 
 
 That was the role she had requested I perform.
 v01be0098
 ベル「...How should I answer her?」
 It's not like I'm uninterested.
  In addition, Wakaba had said she needed me no matter what when she invited me, which made me truly happy.
 ...But after telling me what I would actually do, I could hardly imagine it.
  I felt that I didn't have the confidence to do such a thing.

 v01be0100
 ベル「Yeah.」
 st11_a02
 v11re0123
 レイン「Are you worried about Wakaba asking you to perform in her play?」
 Father is the one who told Wakaba that I liked singing, so his deduction was simple logic.
 
 v01be0101
 ベル「...That's right. Why did you tell her so much about me?」
 My father knows that even though I enjoy singing, I can't sing while anyone else is watching.
 
 So why didn't he reject Wakaba's request when she asked?
 st11_a01

 v01be0104

 Lately, Father has always been acting like this, For example, just now, he hasn't given me any advice even though I'm troubled.
 
 If I ask something like ‘Should I?’―
 st11_a07
 v11re0127
 レイン「Don't rely on me for your answer. You should decide that for yourself.」
 ...He would surely reply in that way.
 v01be0105

 Even though I knew that wasn't true, I couldn't help feeling depressed.
 v01be0106

 v01be0109

 v11re0132

 v01be0111

 Until now, I haven't even left Silberg more than a few times, let alone gone to the Blue City.
 
 st11_a00

 レイン「Hm? Cero and his companions are headed to the White City. They will see you safely to the Blue City on their way... that's what I requested of them. Does that bother you?」
 
 
 
 v01be0113
 ベル「Of course not...」
 st11_a00
 v11re0136

 black450
 bg07a02
 v01be0114
 ベル「...Even if you say that...」
 I understood what Father meant.
 Having me get to know Cero and his friends first before I decided whether to perform in the play...
  that's what he had decided.
 But, if I do that, I will―
 v01be0115
 ベル「(―Surely accept it...)」
 Even though I've known them for less than half a day, I know they're kind people.
  If possible, I would like to help Wakaba.
 ...But, the play requires me not only to stand beside the princess, it also requires me to sing.
 
 I love singing.
  But only when I'm alone.
 Even when the children in the village ask me to sing for them, it never turns out well, because my voice is too timid for anyone to hear.
 
 If even my father overhears me so much as humming a tune, it's a huge shock.
  If I were to perform in a play on stage... there's no way I could do that.
 v01be0116

 I'm sure I would ruin the play and cause trouble for everyone.
  No matter how much I practice―

 v01be0131
 ベル「Are you going to perform in the play?」
 st05_a05

 Even though I've never seen Wakaba act like that, I could easily envision it.
 
 st05_a00

 That goes for Wakaba and Light both.

 ライト「It's not about trust... I just don't think anyone else could handle her. If someone else went out with her, I'd be more worried for them than for Sis.」

 st05_a02

 ライト「Nope, that's how it is. Try living with Sis for three days... no, I'm sure you couldn't stand even one day with her.」
 
 v01be0142
 ベル「...Ehehehe.」
 I couldn't help but laugh, because Wakaba had said almost exactly the same thing earlier.
 
 Light and Wakaba really are brother and sister.
 v01be0143
 ベル「...I'm envious.」
 st05_a05
 v05li0363
 ライト「Hm? Of what?」
 v01be0144
 ベル「...No, it's nothing.」
 After living for so long in Silberg, I've met many sorts of children from the village, and watched them all grow up.
 First, newborn babies who grow and learn how to talk, then children who can play with me in the hills, and finally, adults who look older than I do.
 
 
 black450
 Of course, that wasn't my actual age.
 It's just that humans show their age as they grow, 
 
 but that isn't the case for a Sister like me.
 The children that I watch grow into adults, they ultimately find someone whom they love and get married, and then they introduce their newborn children to me.
 
 In those moments, I am filled with joy.
 But except for that, I've always felt that I was alone―

 Light looked as if he was still curious, but he didn't say anything in the end.
 
 st05_a01
 v05li0367
 ライト「...Ah, by the way, why do you want to go to the Blue City?」
  he said, changing the topic.
 v01be0147

 v05li0368
 ライト「Oh, who is it?」
 v01be0148
 ベル「Her name is Choco, and she plays the trumpet.」
 st05_a08
 v05li0369
 ライト「Whoa, she sounds cool! Hey, can we meet her when we get to the Blue City?」
 
 v01be0149
 ベル「Sure. I'm sure you'll like her.」
 I'll think more about performing in the play, but for now I'll just talk about my friends with Light.
 
 I should go to the Blue City first... I guess.
 Maybe by then, I'll have figured out what I should do.

 st11_a05
 v11re0143
 レイン「Hm? Where on your right leg? Your foot? Your lower leg? Or your knee?」
 
 
 
 
 Grandpa lightly knocked on my leg three times, beginning at the bottom part and going upwards.
 It didn't hurt, but somehow it tickled.
 st11_a00
 v11re0144
 レイン「Out of those three spots earlier, which did you feel unwell at?」
 v02co1332

 I pointed at the last place he had knocked,

 st11_a00
 v11re0146

 Even though having Gramps staring at me like that makes me feel slightly embarrassed, I slowly moved my legs anyway.
 
 v02co1335
 ココ「Ah-, It's, fine, now-」
 Now there's no problem!
 I don't hurt anywhere anymore.
 v02co1336
 ココ「Awe- some, Gramps-」
 st11_a01

 v02co1338
 ココ「Uaa-, Ah-」
 st11_a00
 v11re0149
 レイン「All right, that's good, keep it up.」
 With my mouth this wide open, if he tells me to do something else, that would be bad.
 But, I mustn't close my mouth.
 It's hard to speak without my mouth unable to close and open...
 v02co1339
 ココ「Is- it- done?」
 st11_a02
 v11re0150
 レイン「Not yet, try to keep it wide open a bit longer.」
 v02co1340
 ココ「...O, kay-」
 Grandpa smiled and nodded as he looked into my mouth...
  I wonder what he's doing?
 Could it be that he's searching for something?
 st11_a00
 v11re0151
 レイン「Hmm. There don't seem to be any problems, you can close your mouth now.」
 v02co1341

 And then, Gramps took out the stones from the bottle around my neck.
 After that, he placed them on the desk and examined them one by one.
 st11_a01
 v11re0152

  As he said that, he smiled pleasantly.

 Difficult words. I couldn't understand them.
 But, I do understand that it would be trouble if I were to lose these stones.
 We Sisters
 
  rely on the power of those stones to move.
 Therefore, these stones are precious to us.
 I was told to protect them at all cost.

 st11_a04
 v11re0155
 レイン「...No, never you mind. It's something that happened long, long ago. I've just occasionally thought ‘if that had happened, how nice it would have been’.」
 
 Gramps placed all my stones back into the bottle.
 st11_a01
 v11re0156
 レイン「Keep on protecting them from now on, too,」
  he said.
 v02co1346

 I'm fine.
  I will surely protect them from now onwards.
 It's my promise, to everyone.

 There are some people I can't remember... one, two, or was it three...?
 Everyone told me the same thing.

 He cooks for me, and stays with me when I'm alone.
 When he gets angry, it's because I've done something bad.

 st03_a03

 ワカバ「Ah, y-yeah.」
 In the middle of my lakeside stroll with Wakaba, as we gazed at the setting sun, I raised the topic abruptly.
 v04ce0611

 st03_a03
 v03wa0610
 ワカバ「...I'm sorry. I should have discussed it with you first before asking him. I've been reflecting on that.」
 
 v04ce0612
 セロ「No, I don't think it's a big deal. After all, he's supporting my living and schooling expenses too... It's just that it's a pretty bold idea.」
 
 For the sake of participating in the theater festival, Wakaba had asked for Rein's sponsorship.
 From Rein's perspective, what did he think of this whole situation?
 st03_a07

 Well, at least she's aware that being too rash won't end well...
 v04ce0614
 セロ「...And then you asked Belle if she would perform?」
 st03_a06
 v03wa0613
 ワカバ「Yeah, I went to her room and asked her... She still hasn't made up her mind.」
 v04ce0615

 st03_a07
 v03wa0614
 ワカバ「That's right! Ah, I wonder if she'll accept it while we're still here in Silberg.」
 
 
 Wakaba shook her head vigorously, and let out a heartfelt sigh.
 st03_a02

 ワカバ「Hey, how much longer are we going to stay here?」
 v04ce0616

 ワカバ「E-ehh! That soon? Couldn't we stay here for a while longer?」
 
 
 
 v04ce0617

 st03_a02

 v04ce0618

 st03_a12
 v03wa0618
 ワカバ「Ah, sorry.」
 With Wakaba still holding my wrist imploringly, I started wondering what trouble it would cause if we were to stay here longer.
 
 Even if Belle makes up her mind, we'll still have to go to the Blue Capital together anyway―
 v04ce0619
 セロ「Ah!」
 st03_a09

 ワカバ「Whoa? W, what's wrong? Is there something in the lake? Is it a monster!?」

 st03_a00
 v03wa0620
 ワカバ「Hm, what is it? It's not like I'm that easy to anger.」
 
 Facing her smiling face and innocently blinking eyes, I was a bit nervous.
 Still, I casually told her, ‘We'll be escorting Belle to the Blue Capital.’
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa0621
 ワカバ「Why didn't you tell me an important thing like that sooner?!」
 She shouted, then smacked me on top of that.
 st03_a01
 v03wa0622
 ワカバ「Ah, in that case I don't need to rush! I can just persuade her on the way to the Blue Capital... Huh? Am I going to the Blue Capital too?」
 
 
 v04ce0621
 セロ「...Umm.」
 At this rate, it seems like I'll become irrelevant to the conversation, so I'll clear things up for her.
 
 v04ce0622
 セロ「That's because you rushed out and didn't finish listening to Rein. When he said it was okay, he had some conditions.」
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa0623
 ワカバ「Really!? Then, I'll just have to persuade Belle somehow...」
 
 v04ce0623

 I told her about how we'll need to gather materials at the place where the story happened, research the local folklore that might contain grains of historical truth, and recruit actors on our own.
 
 v04ce0624
 セロ「...If we can do all these, then we'll get sponsored. What do you think?」
 st03_a02
 v03wa0624
 ワカバ「Of course we can do it! ...Which means, we'll be taking a trip to the White Capital.」
 
 
 v04ce0625

 st03_a06

 ワカバ「After that, we'll head for the Red Capital―」
 v04ce0626
 セロ「...Eh?」
 st03_a01
 v03wa0626
 ワカバ「Then, after we've made a circle around the whole country, we'll head back to Moosgrun. It's decided!」
 My explanation had taken less than a minute, but what's with this unexpected leg of the trip?
 
 v04ce0627
 セロ「Why are we going to the Red Capital? The play is set in the present White Capital― Weiss, right?」
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa0627
 ワカバ「But we're stopping at the Blue Capital, and then going on to the White Capital, right? Then we have to go to the Red Capital, too!」
 
 Wakaba said emphatically, as she gazed at me while clenching her fists.
 st03_a02

 st03_a11

 After I told her about the conditions for sponsorship, Wakaba had returned to Rein's house in high spirits.
 
 Then, she immediately found out that Coco's maintenance had already ended.

 It seems there was a portable typewriter inside.
 face11_a04
 v11re0171

 It was most likely that Rein was worried- that's why he gave Wakaba something to help her with her task.

 ワカバ「Actually, I was planning on telling you guys after I finished my outline, but it seems like things aren't going well...」
 
  She confessed.
 We were as clueless as we had been on the train from La Renoncule, but back then, she hadn't decided anything, so she couldn't possibly explain.
 
 Just one day later, we've found a person to sponsor us, and a potential actress.
  Faced with such sudden advancement, it's natural that she's at a loss for words.

 Wakaba nodded her head emphatically, and took a deep breath.

 Somehow it feels like I'm always acting as a mediator, or am I just imagining that?
 v03wa0654
 ワカバ「...To put it simply! Long ago, there was a princess living in the White Kingdom, located between the Red and Blue Kingdoms. Her name was Christina Dorn.」

 The two of them went on quarreling, all the way to the train station.
  Just as I thought Wakaba would continue her explanation,
 st03_a00

 ワカバ「...Then, it seems that the princess was killed by the regent, Ein.」
 
  She ended it instantly.

 v05li0384
 ライト「Shut up! ...So, what happened after that? Did it really end after the princess died?」
 
 
 st03_a06
 v03wa0659
 ワカバ「...Nope. In the play, when Ein tried to escape the kingdom, he was killed by the Red and Blue Kingdom's united armies.」
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa0660
 ワカバ「―At that time, the Red and Blue army were told of Ein's whereabouts by the Sister who served the princess.」
 
 
 
 face01_a06
 v01be0154

 v03wa0661
 ワカバ「...That's right. After that, no one knows where the Sister who had achieved her vengeance went... The end.」
 
 
 
 face05_a06

 ライト「Hmm, as expected, good triumphs over evil.」
 st03_a04

 ワカバ「Well, if Ein really were evil... then that would be okay.」
 Wakaba grinned meaningfully.

 st03_a00

 st03_a01
 v03wa0664
 ワカバ「That's right, but I'm not going to make the princess into a villain... That would be impossible. What do you think of the story with this twist: the betrayer, Ein, is in truth a good person?」
 
 As I already knew about her twist, I observed the others' reaction.
 face05_a03
 v05li0387
 ライト「...Sis, are you sure you can do that? Isn't that dishonest?」
 
 st03_a02

 ワカバ「How can you say that!? How is it dishonest?」
 
 face05_a08

 ライト「That's because, it seems like... you're turning the whole story upside down.」
 v03wa0666
 ワカバ「...Idiot! That's the whole point! I'm thinking really hard about how I can make the audience accept a change like this!」

 Belle was startled out of her reverie by Light's question.
 face01_a03
 v01be0157
 ベル「I'm quite curious what happened to that Sister afterwards...」
 
 
 
  she admitted.
 Is she curious because
 
  they're both Sisters?
 st03_a07
 v03wa0667
 ワカバ「Hm, now I'm not sure about the ending either.」
 st03_a03
 v03wa0668
 ワカバ「―If Ein is a good person, he won't kill the princess. ...Which means the act of retribution will also disappear, right, Cero?」
 
 
 v04ce0642
 セロ「...I guess.」
 Even if her plot doesn't hold water, writing the script is not my job, so I don't have much to say about it.
 st03_a04
 v03wa0669
 ワカバ「Oh well, we'll figure it out bit by bit! We'll definitely have some good ideas by the time we reach the White City!」
 
 Finally, as Wakaba came to her optimistic conclusion, we reached the train station.

 ライト「Eh, Fa, is this the first time you've been on a train?」
 v01be0159
 ベル「Yes, that's right.」
 The first time I came to Silberg, it was in a shaky horse-drawn carriage.
  And whenever I left the village, I always took one of Father's friends' automatic cars.
 st05_a00

 ライト「Hm, so that's how it is. ...Ah, where should I put the luggage? Is it all right if I put them on the overhead luggage rack?」
 
 v01be0160

 I'm not that strong, so I can't lift heavy things.
 After I admitted that to Light, he helped me carry my luggage.
  I think that he's really a dependable boy.
 st05_a08

 Light straightened his back, and put the luggage on the rack over his head.
 
 And then,
 st05_a00
 v05li0393
 ライト「Do you want me to put that basket on top too?」
  Light said, pointing at that which was held in my arms.
 v01be0161
 ベル「I'm okay like this, thank you.」
 st05_a01

 ライト「No, you're welcome.」
 Light's kindness makes me happy, but I'd rather keep this basket on my lap.
 v01be0162

 I took the opportunity when nobody was looking, and lightly knocked on the basket's lid.

 after the train began moving and everyone started chatting, Light kept glancing at my basket.

 After noticing that, I decided to tell Light my secret.

 st05_a05

 Luckily, Coco was mesmerised by Wakaba's shadow play and wasn't paying attention to us.
 v01be0176

 I apologized to her in my heart, and nonchalantly stood up.

  His answer reassured me.

 As Light said that, he looked troubled.
 v01be0180
 ベル「(―Could it be because he thinks it's childish?)」
 For a long time I've been bad at getting up in the mornings. If it wasn't for the friends my father gave me, I'd never be able to wake up.
 
 v01be0181
 ベル「(―I'd probably be teased if I told Cero or Wakaba.)」
 The rest of them are adults already, I'm sure they can wake up without an alarm―
 As I thought about that, I started discussing it with Light, and asked him ‘what can I do to keep the stuff in my basket a secret?’
 
 And then, I mentioned the one person who absolutely cannot know this secret- Coco.
 
 st05_a01

 To let her take revenge for what I did to her, I offered her my own cheek.

 I felt Belle's hair lightly brush my cheek, followed by the warmth of her soft lips.
 Startled, I turned my head to the side, but she had already moved her face away.

 How could I even ask for a kiss just after pinching Belle for no reason?
 ...Still, I suppose I'd gotten lucky.
 v00an1459
 アンジ「Do you want a kiss in return?」
 st01_a08
 v01be1181

 Now that I've asked her, there's no way it could be a misunderstanding.
 I gave her a light kiss on the forehead, and quietly slipped my hands around her.

 v01be1182

 I had been wanting to ask her this question since midway through our journey, and that desire had only grown as time passed by.
 
 st01_d04
 v01be1183
 ベル「Me? I'll... go back home.」
 
 An obvious answer. All I could say is ‘I thought so’.
 She still had her father, an irreplaceable family member of hers.
 Even though it was a relationship between a human and a Schwester, it was still a close bond.

 ベル「Miss Angelina, what about you?」
 v00an1462
 アンジ「I'm not going to go back home. ...Ah, before you misunderstand, it's not like I don't want to go back because I hated it there, okay?」
 
 st01_d06
 v01be1185
 ベル「...I understand. It's for the sake of your little brothers and sisters, right?」
 She's really quick on the uptake about these kind of things.
 v00an1463
 アンジ「Well, yeah! Don't you think it's less of a burden if there's one person fewer to feed?」
 
 
 v01be1186
 ベル「...Miss Angelina.」
 v00an1464
 アンジ「Furthermore, if I can become an actress, and send home the spare money I earn... that will help them out too.」
 
 
 ―That's right, my dream was that simple.
 When I was young, I hated being poor. Whenever I saw children who had rich families, I would always be envious of them.
 
 That's why my ambition at that time was just to be rich!
 But, as time went on, the way I thought about things changed too, and I had begun to hope that someday I could do something not just for myself, but for others as well.
 
 
 And the path by which I had chosen to do that was theater.
 Being an actress would make me happier than anything I could ever ask for.
 I could entertain the audience while earning money, and nobody would have any complaints.
 
 I'm going to use that money, and bring happiness to everyone at home.
 After I achieve that―
 v00an1465
 アンジ「(―Maybe we can build an addition, with a room of my own.)」
 ...As if I really could. These are all just dreams right now.

 v00an1467
 アンジ「Thank you. If that's the case, I'll reserve the ticket of the best seat for you.」
 st01_d02

 ベル「...Please leave that for your family too. I'll definitely come and watch you even without those seats.」

 Her words brought a smile to my face. I lightly stroked her head, and looked up at the sky.
 
 ―And now, for that sake of achieving that dream,
 I mustn't fail my first performance, no matter what.

 What happened after that, I did not know.

 That Dua, Ein, the Princess, and Efa.

 The train route from Silberg to the Blue City has a stop in Pervenche.
 
 Since this is a normal train, there are tons of stops, and we were making slow progress.

 v03wa1920
 ワカバ「If you don't work on your summer homework now, you're not going to finish it on time, right?」
 ev004f
 The train had spent ten minutes sitting at a small stop in the mountains.
 According to the conductor, they're waiting for passengers from another train to switch into theirs and vice versa,
  but there are no other trains nearby.
 ev004c
 v05li0942
 ライト「...It'll be fine!
 When I go home, I'll study hard before I make my deliveries.
  I can do a page in three days.」

 Light's indifference is just as annoying as this train.

 v05li0945
 ライト「That's impossible!
 First of all, the train isn't even moving!」
 ev004c
 I smiled as I listened to the siblings' familiar argument over in the box seat.
 At the start of our trip I had been worried about those two,
  but it seems like my concern was unwarranted. 
 
 v05li0946
 ライト「...Hey, Sis, didn't you bring any snacks?」
 v03wa1924
 ワカバ「I didn't. I already had a lot of luggage, after all.」

 After overhearing their conversation,
  Coco turned to me as if she had just realized something, and stared at me with eyes full of anticipation.

 セロ「...Sure, you can share some snacks with everyone.」
 Grabbing her hint, I took Coco's bag down from the luggage rack and passed it to her.
 v02co1897

 Coco wanted to be friendly and share her specially made deluxe snack assortment
  with everyone.

 That's enough.」
 v02co1899

 Coco turned around and started chatting with Belle.
 v05li0948
 ライト「...So when will this train start moving?」
 v03wa1925
 ワカバ「Who knows?
 Cero, do you?」
 v04ce1823
 セロ「I still can't see any other train to switch passengers with yet... so I guess it's not going to be anytime soon.」
 In a place like this, time seems to pass even slower than usual.
 v05li0949
 ライト「If this goes on, we might never reach Pervenche...」
 v04ce1824
 セロ「I doubt it'll come to that.」
 We've already booked hotel rooms, so it shouldn't be a problem
  if we get there a bit late... I think.
 Since this was our first long distance trip, I did feel uneasy.
  At least since I know we've definitely got rooms waiting for us, I can relax a little.
 v04ce1825
 セロ「(―Well, we can camp out in the open if it comes to that...)」
 Now there's only one problem left.
 Namely, how are we going to split our rooms between five people now that Belle's here?
 
 v04ce1826
 セロ「(―Since Belle is a girl, after all...)」
 Letting her share a room with Wakaba, while Light comes to our room...
  I think that's the best solution.
 But if Belle wants a room to herself, we'll have to change the arrangement we set up back in La Renoncule.
  So it'll be a total of three rooms: Coco with me, Light together with Wakaba, and Belle on her own.
 v04ce1827
 セロ「Hmm.」
 Though I myself had thought this was the most suitable arrangement, 
 I couldn't help but feel like it wasn't much fun.
 v04ce1828
 セロ「(―Oh well.)」
 It's not something that I have to decide right now, anyway.
 In addition, who knows how long we'll end up staying in the Blue Capital.
  If any of them hit it off, the room arrangements can be changed accordingly.

 It seems like those two never run out of energy.
 As I watched the two of them vanish into the neighboring compartment,
  my eyes met with Belle's as she lifted her head over the seat to look around.
 v04ce1830

 st01_a01
 v01be0953
 ベル「That's right.」
 As Belle smiled, I found myself grinning as well.
 v04ce1831

 Belle is different from Coco- she's a Sister created to be
 
 as human as possible.
 When we first met upon that slope,
 
  I hadn't even noticed she was a Sister.
 st01_a00

 v04ce1832

 After that, it seemed like she remembered something.
 st01_a04
 v01be0955
 ベル「Um, I'm sorry. If I don't sleep soon...」
 she muttered, embarrassed. 
 v04ce1833

  I'll tell those two to be more quiet when they return.」
 st01_a01

 As she said that, she lowered her head and fell asleep on the seat.
 I didn't want to disturb her, so I quietly returned to my original seat.
 v04ce1835
 セロ「(―Okay, let's check the schedule.)」
 After departing from Moosgrun, I had calculated that if we went straight back from Silberg, the trip would probably last a week.
  Given our current pace, though, it'll probably take ten days... or even two weeks.

 As I calmed the both of them down, I glanced at Belle.

 Coco, who should have been with her, was missing.

 v03wa1932

 Earlier, when we ran out onto the platform, Coco was there too.
  We planned to catch Sis in a pincer attack.」
 v03wa1933
 ワカバ「P, pincer attack?
 What does that mean!?」
 v05li0958
 ライト「Hmm, I was going to go into the compartment in front, while Coco went into the one behind,
  and whoever found Sis first was going to distract her―」
 v05li0959
 ライト「While the other one would sneak up behind Sis and scare her... like that.」
 v03wa1934
 ワカバ「Are you an idiot?
 You really are, aren't you?
  How would something like that scare me!?」
 v04ce1840

 What's more important right now is that Coco's missing.
 v04ce1841
 セロ「Light!
 Are you sure Coco is still on the train?」
 v05li0960
 ライト「Yeah, I only went back on the train after watching her go in, after all.」
 ev004b
 If that's the case, I'll just search all the compartments.
 But if Coco was still on the platform, or had wandered even further off...
  that would be a huge problem.
 v04ce1842
 セロ「Wakaba, I'm sorry, but please search for Coco in the upper compartments.
  Light, stay here and wait, while I search the compartments behind us.」
 black450
 Ironically, our plan was just the opposite of Light's
  ‘pincer attack’ strategy.
 ev004s
 v03wa1935
 ワカバ「And if we still don't find her after that?」
 v04ce1843

  I only scolded her a little bit.

 セロ「...Listen carefully Coco, I know I've said this before, but...」
 I know she likes playing hide and seek, and I've never prohibited it.

 The weather has been beautiful for the entire trip so far.
 Our gang, now one larger, had reached Pervenche before nightfall on the train from Silberg.
 
 The newest member is a Sister of a different type than Coco, a girl with a single wing on her back― Belle.
 
 
 
 Though it's only because of her father's request to pick up an item that she's coming along with us to the Blue Capital, she's the perfect fit for the angel in my play.

 st04_a08

 I could understand why he was so tired.

 セロ「Really? Then, I'll rest for a while.」
 
 Cero closed his eyes, and the compartment went silent.
 As he settled down to sleep, I stood up to take a look at the seat behind mine.
 My brother and Coco were, amazingly enough, actually being quiet like they'd been told- since they had fallen asleep leaning on each other.
 
 v03wa0687
 ワカバ「...Everyone gets along really well.」
 But, if I followed the trend and went to sleep just like everyone else, that would be a waste of this peace and quiet.
 
 v03wa0688
 ワカバ「All right, time to start writing!」
 Focusing myself, I took out my pencil and paper, placed my thick dictionary on my lap and prepared to work on my script.
 
 ...That said.
 Being this noisy while sitting next to Cero, who just fell asleep, is rude.
 
 v03wa0689

 I moved to the seat across from Belle, who was sleeping soundly, and started my work.
 v03wa0690a
 ワカバ「The first thing to do is... maybe the list of characters? Princess Christina of the White Kingdom...」
 
 And then there's her guardian, Ein. I have to think of a name for the Blue Kingdom's ambassador, and the other people in important positions should be described too.
 
 v03wa0691
 ワカバ「Hmm, what were those people called back then? Something like ministers?」
 
 I decided to ask Cero to help me out with that later.
 v03wa0692
 ワカバ「...Any others... Ah, that's right! The most important character of all...」

 I swiftly added the name of the Sister who was sleeping in front of me― Belle―
 
 to the list.
 v03wa0693

 Though I glanced at her a few times more, it didn't seem like she was about to wake up.
 v03wa0696
 ワカバ「...Oh well. Now, who are the other characters...」
 I wrote down characters who might appear in the play as I thought of them, but needless to say, there were waaaay too many.
 
 With this number, the play would be far too expensive to put on, not to mention how hard it would be to write all the dialogue.

 I counted off in my head the simple roles he could manage, like the tomboyish kid or the door guard.

 v05li0456
 ライト「A, anyway! What about the room arrangement for tonight?」
 
 Yesterday, it was me and Sis and Uncle Cero and Coco, while Fa had a room to herself.
 
 Other than Fa-chan, who joined in the middle of our trip, our group hasn't changed since we left Moosgrun.

 st04_a03
 v04ce0699

 st04_a03
 v04ce0702
 セロ「Having said that, for you to stay in a room alone... That won't work either.」
 That's right, if it turned out like that, things would be really boring.
  Also, I'd have to say ‘bye bye’ to Cero too.
 st04_a05
 v04ce0703

 v04ce0706
 セロ「You do know Wakaba is trying to get Belle to perform at the theater festival, right?」
 v05li0470
 ライト「...Ah, so that's how it is!」
 They were still ‘in the middle of negotiations’ last night... That's what Sis meant, so if they share a room, she should be satisfied.
 
 v05li0471
 ライト「I wonder if Fa will perform?」
 st04_a03

 st04_a00
 v04ce0708
 セロ「Well, of course I hope that she participates. Don't you... feel that way too?」
 
 v05li0473
 ライト「...Ye, yeah.」
 Even though I can't imagine what kind of play it's going to be, if she was specifically chosen by Sis, who is the one writing the script... Belle must really be perfect for that role.
 
 And if Fa decides to join, we could go to the White Capital and maybe even back to Moosgrun together.

 face02_a06

 From a brother's point of view... Or rather, even viewed objectively, that role so does not fit her.

 v04ce0713

 v05li0477
 ライト「Sis is really taking this way too lightly.」
 Even though I always think ‘It'll work out somehow!’ too, Sis has taken it to a new level.
 
 v05li0478

 st04_a01

 Cero smiled lightly. it's amazing that he can think that way.
 
 v05li0479

 I immediately started staring the people who were walking around, as well as the shopkeepers in their stalls.

 v05li0482
 ライト「(―It's not that easy to find someone, after all...)」
 The shopkeepers greeted me with enthusiasm, but they had nothing to do with me searching for actors.
 
 And even if I'd told them about the play and asked them to perform, I don't think anyone would have said ‘Sure thing-!’ immediately.

 But for me, it was fate...

 v03wa0741
 ワカバ「Ah-, it's okay, it's okay! Don't worry about it.」
 
 After all, I've already made Light carry all the luggage.
  ...Now is not the time to worry about something like that.
 Inside my mind, the question ‘Will Belle accept the role?’ asked itself over and over.
 v03wa0742
 ワカバ「(―After she finishes her business, she'll head back immediately, right?)」
 No, maybe not.
 Earlier, Belle hadn't mentioned she'd not be spending the night with us to Light when he was talking about finding a hotel.
 
 ...That means, even in the worst case scenario, she'll stay here with us until tomorrow morning.
 st01_a07
 v03wa0743
 ワカバ「(―Still, I can't take this lying down anymore.)」
 If I don't show her my passion, she might forget about the whole matter.
  If I fail because I didn't put in enough effort... I would definitely regret it.
 I should just say it, right now!
 I don't think Cero asked me to go with Belle for this purpose, but it's the perfect opportunity.
 
 I can't let it slip away.
 v03wa0744
 ワカバ「...Um, you know...」
 st01_a00
 v01be0201
 ベル「I think it's somewhere near here.」
 Before I could finish my sentence, Belle turned in the middle of the road and faced me.
 st01_a05
 v01be0202
 ベル「Eh, did you say something earlier?」
  and blinked in surprise.
 v03wa0745
 ワカバ「Ah, er. The... the place we're looking for is somewhere around here, right?」
 Just like that, I'd wasted my chance.
 st01_a00

 v03wa0746
 ワカバ「If it's all right, may I see the memo again?」
 st01_a06

 Written on the memo was ‘6-11’, which is a street in the following section.
 v03wa0747
 ワカバ「...Hmm, if we're not mistaken about the section's number...」
 Sequentially, the next one should be 6.
 v03wa0748
 ワカバ「It's over here. Come on.」
 st01_a00
 v01be0205
 ベル「Okay.」
 As I adjusted the speed of my stride to match Belle's, I glanced over at the basket she was carrying.
 v03wa0749
 ワカバ「(―By the way, when we were inside the train...)」
 I remembered the time when I had sat across from Belle, and became a bit curious.
 v03wa0750
 ワカバ「Hey, Belle. That basket... what's inside of it?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0206

 She seemed troubled about how she should answer.
 And then Belle―
 st01_a04

  Answered like that.
 v03wa0751
 ワカバ「Friends?」

 v03wa0753
 ワカバ「Oops, we almost passed it.」
 I stopped and looked at the address sign that Belle was pointing at.
 It seems like her destination was the apartment right in front of us.
 v03wa0754
 ワカバ「...All right then, go do your thing.」
 st01_a05

 ベル「...Looks like Wakaba isn't here yet.」
 I looked around the entrance of the apartment we had promised to meet at, but I couldn't see her.
 
 I had spent about thirty minutes with the engineer, which means I'll be waiting for another hour.
 
 st01_d00
 v01be0217
 ベル「(―I thought it would take much longer...)」
 The engineer who was doing Choco's maintenance was an unexpectedly quiet person, so I only had to answer a few questions about my father.
 
 I had figured that he'd have a lot more questions, so it was a relief that it didn't turn out that way.
 st01_d03
 v01be0218
 ベル「...What should I do? There's still quite some time left.」
 
 Should I just wait here for Wakaba?
  Or should I go for a stroll on the nearby streets?
 Either way, I wanted to do some sightseeing.
 st01_d00
 v01be0219
 ベル「...But I must be sure to pay attention, so I'm not late for the meet-up.」
 To make sure I wouldn't get lost, I memorized the area around me carefully and headed out into the street, avoiding the narrow alleys.
 
 It's possible that I might even bump into Wakaba.
 st01_d06
 v01be0220
 ベル「...What a lovely street.」
 Since coming to the Blue Capital, I've noticed that all the buildings here are a lot bigger than those in Silberg.
 Because of the buildings' height, as I looked up... I could only see a small sliver of the sky.
 st01_d04
 v01be0221
 ベル「Compared to this, isn't Silberg just a village?」
 Even though I've never yearned to live in the big city, I don't hate streets like these either... Still, I think I like places surrounded by nature much more.
 
 st01_d06
 v01be0222
 ベル「...As the saying goes, ‘There's no place like home.’」
 I'm sure, from the perspective of the people who live here, that this city is the perfect home.
 People from elsewhere, even if they wanted to visit Silberg to see the scenery, would probably never think of moving there.
 
 st01_d05
 v01be0223
 ベル「Ah! I should go buy some souvenirs for Father, shouldn't I?」
 
 In that case, I'll have to leave the residential area, and head for the market district.
 But I probably don't have enough time to go there and back.
 st01_d00
 v01be0224
 ベル「(―I'll do that after meeting with everyone.)」
 That way, I'll know where the hotel is, which means I can go anywhere I want.
 If it's already dark by then, then I'll look around tomorrow.
 st01_d03
 v01be0225
 ベル「(―Tomorrow...)」
 I stopped in my tracks.
  ...When tomorrow comes, what should I do?
 Wakaba and her friends' lonely faces suddenly appeared in my mind.
 I had finished my business in the Blue Capital, so I no longer have a reason to stay here.
 Wakaba won't remain here either. Her group will continue their journey, and head to their next destination― the White Capital.
 As things are, I'll be going back to Silberg by myself.
 st01_d07
 v01be0226
 ベル「(―What to do? What should I do?)」
 
 I really want to travel with them for a little longer.
 But, for that to happen... I have to accept Wakaba's invitation.
 st01_d03
 v01be0227
 ベル「...I don't know what to do.」
 If it's Wakaba, even if I don't participate in the play and just help out behind the stage, she'll probably still welcome me into her group.
 
 But, I don't want to do that.
 Because Wakaba wishes for me to stand on the stage, I want to do what I can to fulfill that wish.
 That's why I would have no choice but to sing in front of an audience.
 
 st01_d07
 v01be0228
 ベル「(―That would be impossible for me as I am now.)」
 No matter what kind of song it is, I can only sing when I'm alone.
 ...In front of people, I'm too shy to even make a peep.
 st01_d03
 v01be0229
 ベル「...What can I do so that I can sing?」
 As I looked at my basket, I sighed.
 v01be0230
 ベル「(―In front of my friends in here, I would be fine.)」
 If these children are the only audience, then everything would be fine... As I thought of that, I realized a bigger problem.
 
 No matter how I think of it, the other actors would be able to hear me anyway.
 st01_d07
 v01be0231
 ベル「...I can't do it.」
 I didn't want to lie to Wakaba and her friends by telling them ‘I can do it.’
  In order not to trouble them, I should let them find someone else.
 st01_d03
 v01be0232
 ベル「(―I'm sorry, Wakaba.)」
 When we meet later, I'll reject her invitation and tell her my reason.
 v03wa0597
 ワカバ「Then that's more than enough! You have potential! You just have to practice!」
 
 
 Faced with Wakaba, ever so optimistic... could I tell her?
  As I thought of that, my chest hurt.

 I thanked her in my heart once more.

 she even told me I could take home leftover meat when it still could have been sold.

 There's a fountain at the corner of this residential street. It's a place that I like a lot.
 Even though it's a recreational area, not many people use it.
 st00_d00
 I discovered this place about a year ago.
 ―The area isn't too wide or too narrow.
 There's enough space to pretend it's a stage, and the walls surrounding the area have good acoustics.
 
 At first, my voice was too loud and caused a disturbance for the people living nearby.
 But since, I've learned to control my voice and recite my lines at a less conspicuous volume.
 
 Of course, if there's anyone else around, I'll just recite and review my lines silently so I don't disturb them.

 If it's the woman who always sits by the corner, I could just bid her a good afternoon.
 
 But if it's someone else... I didn't bring my script, so I guess I'll stop after practicing whatever lines I can remember off the top of my head.

 Her clothes were as white as snow, matching the wing decoration on her back.

 She reminded me of a drawing of a fairy I'd seen once.
 The wind passing between the buildings lightly tousled her wavy blond hair.

 ベル「...Ah-, Ah-. Is that enough?」
 The hand upon her throat slowly slid downwards and spread itself out.
 It seems like she hadn't noticed me yet.
 Whereas I couldn't move forward, nor back... but only stare at the sight of her.
 The girl stepped forward.

 In her clear voice, she began to sing out a beautiful melody.

 I can't do anything but stand still and listen.
 Belatedly, yet naturally... her melody found words.
 v00an0049
 アンジ「(―Gazing at the sky, promised to the birds...)」
 If I had known that song, I wouldn't just have stood there and repeated her lyrics in my head. I would surely have sung along beside her.

 セロ「...Oh, man...」
 Because it'd taken so long to settle things at the hotel, it was almost past the meeting time already, so I'd let Coco and Light go on ahead.
 
 By the time I catch up, I'll probably miss our arranged meeting time of five o'clock.
 v04ce0719
 セロ「(―Who could have known something like this would happen?)」
 Just when we thought we'd found two suitable rooms so quickly, we ran into a problem registering, because Coco and Belle are Sisters.
 
 
 
 The seedy-looking hotel manager had said that because the Blue Capital greatly respects Sisters, it has special regulations regarding them.
 
 
 
 We'd never even heard of something like that in La Renoncule or Pervenche, but even though we were puzzled, we followed the instructions and filled out the registration documents.
 
 
 ...It's just that when we'd reached the personal identification part, we called Rein's number, and all our problems ended up solved in an instant.
 
 After the hotel manager had asked to speak to the person on the other end―
 He told us not to worry about the price, and said that we'd be getting the finest rooms.
 
 v04ce0720
 セロ「(―It's because Rein's famous, and we're his ‘acquaintances...’ So we received special treatment.)」
 
 
 When I realized that, I somehow didn't feel right accepting the offer.
 Even though I felt bad for not discussing it with Wakaba and the others first, I had only booked the rooms temporarily, telling the manager we only wanted to stay one night.

 ワカバ「Ah, Cero! You're late. Did you finish getting our rooms?」

 st03_a01
 v03wa0761
 ワカバ「I guess. Anywhere is fine, I just want to put these bags down.」
 Wakaba nodded in agreement, and everyone started towards the hotel.
 I told Light and Coco that we were going to the same hotel as before and let them run on ahead, while I discussed the hotel booking incident with Wakaba.
 
 st03_a09
 v03wa0762
 ワカバ「...Something like that happened?」
 Though I don't know if my explanation actually made sense to her, Wakaba seemed to feel the same way I did about it.
 st03_a06
 v03wa0763
 ワカバ「It wasn't a mistake. I would have canceled the reservation too, if it had been me there.」
  she told me.

 st03_a04

 ワカバ「Eh? Don't mention it, I just happen to see it the same way.」
 
 As Wakaba laughed, her expression clouded over.
 st03_a03
 v03wa0765
 ワカバ「...But, are the other hotels like that too?」
  she said.
 v04ce0724
 セロ「Who knows? There's no way to know unless we go check them out......」
 
 As I wondered if we would get the same treatment again, I felt disgusted.

 v04ce0725

 According to Wakaba, she and Belle had split up earlier, and Belle had seemed out of it ever since.
 
 v04ce0726
 セロ「Now that you mention it, she did seem that way before.」

 And so we finished our check-in and started enjoying our free time.
 
 We divided up the rooms the way Light and I had decided on at the market earlier.
 I left Coco with Wakaba and Belle, who were resting in their room, and headed out.

 ライト「Anyway, I want to search for her before I forget! I'll come back after I've found her!」
 
 v04ce0730

 Light didn't stop when I called him, and quickly ran off.
  Even though I just wanted to ask when he'll be back―
 v04ce0731
 セロ「Oh well. I have the key, but if he comes back first, he can go to Wakaba's room.」
 It didn't seem there was a problem, so rather than chasing after Light, I headed for the market.
 
 There's got to be some books here that I can't get in Moosgrun... Finding them should be fun.
 
 v04ce0732
 セロ「(―I have to be careful not to spend all my money.)」
 To save cash, I'll only buy one or two books.
 If there are still more books I'm interested in... I'll go to the city's library to review them there before considering the purchase.

 My mother, Nicola, is the most noble person in this orphanage.
 All right, calling her ‘noble’ is a bit much, but she's a wonderful mother.
 
 Even though she has an impish tongue, she's always working hard to support the orphanage for the childrens' sake.
 
 All of the older siblings who have left this orphanage and became independent have said the same thing to me, 
 
 ‘Please take care of Mother.’
 Now, they help the younger kids like us in the form of an ‘allowance,’ to repay Mother.
 
 ...Still, that doesn't mean that this orphanage's financial situation is secure.
 
 There's no telling when we'll get more children, and the building structure, which is growing older year by year, needs repairs too.
 
 
 
 Also... if we rely too much on the older siblings' help, we'll never become independent.

 As she looked inside,

 Since Wakaba had frozen up, I took the plastic bag and looked inside. In the bag was a lump of meat, probably a kilogram's worth.

 Light's loud shout startled both me and Wakaba.
 Then, before we had the chance to say anything, he―

 ライト「Idiot! Do whatever you want, Sis!」
 
 yelled that, and ran outside to the street.

 I didn't know what to make of the sudden turn of events, and could only stand there in bewilderment.

 ワカバ「Leave that brat alone! He'll come back when he's hungry anyway.」
 
 Wakaba gave a ‘hmph,’ and turned away from me.

 Even if I were to chase after Light, I surely couldn't catch up to him with my legs.
 
 Plus, I wouldn't be able to follow him if he ducked into the crowd.
 Now that it's come to this, all we can do is wait for Cero, the mediator, to come back...

 Even though saying something random and running off was my own fault, if I had told her the real reason―

 ライト「...She definitely wouldn't have let me go.」
 Usually, whenever Sis doesn't understand something, she just says ‘I hear nothing, I know nothing!’
 
 Even though I'm talking to her, she won't listen and just puts on that smug attitude.

 After getting away from my sister, I had gone to one of the market streets.
 If I go there at the same time as before, I just might encounter her... Even though I thought that, it was a bit of a stretch.
 That's why I just meant to go on a stroll there and back.
  ...Still, obviously I wasn't able to find her.
 When I was just about to give up, I happened to glance into a shop, and―

 Even though her clothes were slightly different, it was without a doubt the person I'd seen yesterday.

 アンジ「...Oof...」
 Standing at the shop counter, she sighed as she pounded the meat in front of her.
 Her image was slightly different from that of the ‘graceful beauty’ I had in my mind, but that's just a minor problem.
 I knew this could be nothing but a fated meeting.
  ...Yet I could do nothing but stare blankly at her.

 アンジ「You're here for some meat, right?」
 Normally, I would just say no, but I was dumbfounded.

 If I don't say anything, she might think I'm a weirdo.
 v05li0532

  I tried to ask suavely.
 Now, naturally, she'll start explaining to me which cut is the best― But she didn't even look at me, and absentmindedly said,
 
 v00an0084
 アンジ「I recommend it all. Everything is a good bargain today.」
 
 As the conversation didn't continue as I had expected, I grew agitated.
 
 I looked at the meat placed at the racks, but I hadn't come here to buy, so I couldn't think of choosing any of them.
 
 v00an0085
 アンジ「...Have you decided?」
 v05li0533
 ライト「Ah, err...」
 I tried not to get nervous, but my heart was still thumping as I stared at the price of the meat and tried to remember how much I had in my wallet.

 ライト「...Why did I point to this big piece of meat?」
 Inside the plastic bag was the large chunk of meat I had bought.
  I'm so lame...
 Even if Sis was shocked by this, she ought to understand when she calms down. But nobody would be happy to see this.
 
 v05li0536
 ライト「...*sigh*...」
 I'd even forgotten she could slice it for me and had bought the whole piece... There's almost nothing left in my wallet now.
 I had no money, and was alone in a city I knew nothing about... what do I do now?
 
 I'd just argued with Sis earlier, I couldn't go back even if I wanted to.
 v05li0537
 ライト「Ugh, I feel like crying. Since it's come to this, should I eat this meat?」
 Just as I was seriously considering that, I realized there was someone looking at me from the opposite corner of the street.

 I didn't think she meant any harm, but still, I have to be careful.

 He replied that unexpectedly, and crossed his arms as he began thinking, without needing any further explanation.

 If one of us were to ask for more details, would Wakaba lose control of her emotions?

 v10ni0069
 ニコラ「...That's reassuring to hear.」
 Unlike Coco, at first the children surrounding Belle were only staring at her.
 When Belle noticed those stares, she smiled and hid behind a pillar.
 Then, when the children glanced elsewhere, Belle revealed her face... Just like that, a game like ‘hide and seek’ had begun.

 st01_a06
 v01be0284
 ベル「Not at all. Like this, we can slowly shorten the distance between us.」
 As she said that, it reminded me...
 Children who have just arrived at the orphanage seem to feel ashamed, and won't call me as ‘Mother.’
 
 But soon after that, for some reason they'll eventually start calling me that... And then, they never stop. 
 
 Watching Belle humoring the children to such an extent, she must want to shorten the distance between them quickly.

 On the outside, she looked similar to my children. But this Sister's age was far greater than that.

 But that was over two decades ago. I have little confidence in that memory.

 Just right now, I had remembered something. ...But, memories really do fade easily.

 v10ni0078

 v10ni0081
 ニコラ「Ahahaha, then that's good.」
 She clearly didn't recall me. Still, I didn't think she would lie for the sake of matching my story.
 
 At the time I had visited, she must have lived a tranquil life... That's why she knew it was herself at that time.
 v10ni0082
 ニコラ「Thank you.」
 st01_a06
 v01be0290

 From the point of view of someone as old as I... She was truly an angel, come to deliver a nostalgic memory to me.
 
 In the eyes of this angel, what did she think of how we humans changed over time?

 After my shift ended, I'd headed home and was back before I knew it.
 I've been out of it ever since I checked the audition results first thing this morning.
 
 I pounded the meat too much, and was in a daze as I dealt with the customers.

 To distract myself from my shame, I looked up at the sky and sighed.

 アンジ「...It's pointless to regret it, I knew from the start that the audition might turn out this way.」
 There are candidates who get accepted, and there are candidates who get rejected. This time, I'm one of the latter.
 
 Even though one of the judges wrote ‘Should get more on-stage experience’ in the commentary―
 
 st00_d08

 Now that I've been eliminated from the second audition, I'm out of chances to perform on stage.

 In the past, I've learned a lot from attending school for just a few months.

 But, if I'm ever going to go back, I'll need a lot more of a certain something.

  and said that.
 
 v00an0095
 アンジ「―The reason is simple. I got eliminated from the audition.」
 It wasn't something I could hide, after all, so I answered honestly.
 Besides, I owed Lulu, who had often helped me practice by reading the parts opposite me.

 According to Lulu, Coco was out playing with all our siblings when she first got here.

 It seems he's Coco's caretaker, and lives with her in Moosgrun.

 Apparently the older sister, Wakaba, wants to become a novelist.
 It felt like she was staring at me the whole time, which made me really uncomfortable.

 His shoulders slumped.
 v00an0119
 アンジ「...Sorry.」
 Even though it's too late now, I silently apologized to Light in my room.
 It seems like he'd bought something from the shop when I was still in a daze.
 
 The proof of that lies in the kitchen... where there's a chunk of meat from my shop.
 
 v00an0120
 アンジ「But, I wonder why Light... wanted to buy raw meat?」
 There were still some unsolved mysteries, but I decided to leave them as they were.

 The other Schwester, Belle.
 
 
 She was out helping Mom with the shopping at that time, so I haven't had the chance to meet her yet.

 Is she a cute Schwester, like Coco?

 Wakaba took out a piece of paper and started a simple sketch.
 I peeked over her shoulder curiously, and saw a rough contour that could only have been recognized by a person who'd seen the original poster.

 First of all, she's being way too vague.

 アンジ「(―Geez, Wakaba. It's already late, you know...)」
 Wakaba had loudly demanded ‘Why not, why not-?’ of me over and over, drawing the attention of all the kids nearby.
 
 Luckily, since she was bothering everyone, I could use that as an excuse to ask her to leave―
 st00_d07

 アンジ「...Haa. What a day.」
 Being eliminated from the audition, and getting a weird invitation from a weird person.
 st00_d03
 v00an0150
 アンジ「(―Well, the opportunity to stand on stage is tempting, but...)」
 The script isn't finished, and her chance of gathering all the other actors don't look promising either.
 To be frank, Wakaba isn't even close to being a pro... She's just a girl who likes novels, and a total amateur when it comes to plays.
 
 Since I'm not a pro either, I can't be condescending, but no matter how I look at it, it's unlikely her play will be a success.
 
 st00_d08
 v00an0151
 アンジ「(―Should I have told her off more harshly?)」
 If I embarrass her, and set a condition that she has to gather all the other actors first...
 
 She might give up and look for someone else.

 Her mention of a mustached man reminded me of my father and piqued my curiosity, so I glanced over at the television set.
 
 Though the sound was too quiet for me to make out, judging by the screen, we were watching the movie ‘The Bandit and the Bounty Hunter.’
 
 It seems like the movie started quite some time ago already. We were already in the middle of a fight scene.

 In time with the flashes on the screen, Coco quietly mimicked the sound effects.
 As I watched along with her, I felt somehow that I'd seen this before with Father.

 I only left Silberg three days ago, but am I homesick already?
 
 v02co1441
 ココ「Boom―」
 v01be0316
 ベル「(―How strange.)」
 Even though I've been away for much longer periods before, just three days are enough to worry me now.
 
 But, as Father said before:
 The true passage of time is equal for all, but how long those minutes feel is different for everyone...
 
 Does that apply to Sisters too?
 
 
 If the Drops that power us are different, maybe we Sisters feel things differently too.
 
 
 Or is it due to the combination of our bodies and the Drops?
 
 
 Or could my sense of time be altered by my experiences and memories?
 If one of these guesses is correct, does that mean that the three days I've spent with Coco felt differently for her than they did for me?
 
 v01be0317
 ベル「(―Whose feelings most resemble mine, I wonder?)」
 Are they more like Coco's, who's a Sister like me, though I've only just met her?
 
 
  Or am I more like my father, who is human, but whom I've stayed with for such a long time?
 If I were to dwell on it more deeply, I'm wondering whether I'm more like a Sister or a human―

 Since it was almost over, I decided to watch the rest of it with Coco.
 But rather than watching the end of a movie I've already seen, I'm more interested in what the voices I can just barely make out from the other room are saying.
 
 「(―I shouldn't eavesdrop.)」
 「(―I wonder who Marion is?)」
 sv013a
 v01be0328
 ベル「(―I wonder who Marion is?)」
 Considering how Angelina panicked when she was heard about the call, the caller probably isn't a ‘friend.’
 
 To make someone like Angelina worry about her appearance... it's probably someone she really cares about, or respects?
 
 Even though I know what I'm doing is wrong, I still focused on the conversation coming from the other room.

 Lady?
 Is Angelina talking to a noblewoman?
  Maybe the orphanage has patrons?
 v00an0183

 After that, she made several sounds of agreement,
 v00an0184

 After she said goodbye, I heard her hanging up.
 Then, a little while later, Angelina came into the dining hall.

 Even though I'm interested, I can't just listen in other people's private conversations.
 As I thought that, I tried to focus on the television screen in front of me.
  But,

 アンジ「Of course not! I wouldn't have bothered trying if I knew I would fail!」
 
 v00an0182

 Finally, the bounty hunter, who had been shot but not killed, stood up and finished off the careless bandit in a single shot when he turned his head.

 アンジ「...That's right. Not to brag, but she has quite a reputation.」
 After all, I have quite a bit of admiration for and pride in my mentor.
 v00an0215
 アンジ「Ah! But in case you were... don't even think of asking her to perform in that theater festival, okay?」
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa0871
 ワカバ「Don't worry. Even I won't request that of anyone who I happen to meet.」
 v00an0216
 アンジ「...Phew!」
 st03_a02
 v03wa0872
 ワカバ「In addition, I have higher standards than you'd expect.」
 v00an0217
 アンジ「...Oh, really?」
 st03_a09
 v03wa0873
 ワカバ「Of course! It's a bit odd to say it myself, but I'm pretty picky about appearances.」
 
 v00an0218
 アンジ「Hmm. Picky about appearance, huh?」
 If it's my mentor, she's gifted in both appearance and talents, so she would easily pass.
 v00an0219
 アンジ「Have you found a new candidate?」
 st03_a07
 v03wa0874
 ワカバ「Not even one.」
 v00an0220
 アンジ「...If that's the case, will you ask Cero to perform?」
 st03_a05
 v03wa0875
 ワカバ「Huh, Cero? What does that mean? It's not like I chose Cero just because of his looks, you know.」
 
 
 
 v00an0221
 アンジ「...Eh? What are you talking about? I'm asking about whether if you don't have enough actors, you'll ask Cero to perform too.」
 
 
 
 st03_a11
 v03wa0876
 ワカバ「D, d, don't ask in a way that's so easy to misunderstand! You surprised me,」
 
 Wakaba stuttered with a red face. Could she...?
 
 v00an0222
 アンジ「But, if that happens, Cero wouldn't be the only one. Even Light will have to perform, right?」
 st03_a06
 v03wa0877
 ワカバ「...I guess. I'm just being particular about the main cast. I'd like to have right of refusal over them all, but compromising is important.」
 
 I had thought Wakaba was the type to reject anyone not to her liking.
 
 But unexpectedly, she had a more realistic outlook.
 v00an0223
 アンジ「By the way, I heard that you asked that Schwester to perform on stage too.」
 
 
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa0878
 ワカバ「Yeah, that's right. Belle was the first one I invited. It was a while ago, but she hasn't come to a decision yet.」
 
 v00an0224
 アンジ「...Seems like it. She looked pretty troubled, after all.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0879
 ワカバ「She's different from you. Whenever I tried to press her, she shrinks back... she must be really timid.」
 
 So is she claiming it's okay for her to press me as much as she like?
 bg10a01

 v03wa0880
 ワカバ「Well, it'll work out somehow! ...So, which way should I go from here to reach the stationary shop?」
 
 v00an0225
 アンジ「After walking straight down that road, turn right and then left when you see a corner. You'll see the signboard by then.」
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa0881
 ワカバ「Thank you! Now, I wonder how many ribbons I should buy?」
 
 As I watched Wakaba cheerily take out her wallet, I also reached into the pocket of my skirt.
 
 She had invited me, but I had promised to treat her today.
 So, I'd brought more money than usual.
 v00an0226
 アンジ「...H, huh? How strange, my wallet...」
 
 Inside my pocket, there was nothing except for a few receipts.
 At first, I thought I had dropped it somewhere―
 v00an0227
 アンジ「(―No, I might have just forgotten it beside the mirror before I left the house.)」
 If I go back now, I won't make it in time.
 But I can't just go to the sidewalk cafe with empty pockets either...
 
 st03_a05
 v03wa0882
 ワカバ「...Anne, what's wrong?」
 v00an0228
 アンジ「Wakaba! You're still here?」
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa0883
 ワカバ「Yes, because that queasy expression on your face worries me. Are you not feeling well?」
 v00an0229
 アンジ「...Um, well, actually...」
 If I borrow some money from Wakaba, it would solve this crisis.
 But is that something I should ask of someone I met not long ago?
 st03_a00
 v03wa0884
 ワカバ「Actually... what?」
 v00an0230
 アンジ「It seems that I... forgot my wallet.」
 st03_a05
 v03wa0885
 ワカバ「My, what a dilemma.」
 v00an0231
 アンジ「Don't just make a flippant remark like that! I'm going to an important―」
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa0886
 ワカバ「...Here, take this.」
 Wakaba handed me her own wallet.
 v00an0232
 アンジ「...Wakaba... this...」
 st03_a01
 v03wa0887
 ワカバ「Take it. I've already checked the amount inside. You can return it to me when you get home. No interest, of course.」
 
 v00an0233
 アンジ「You're really letting me borrow it just like that? Aren't you going to buy the ribbons?」
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa0888
 ワカバ「Um, then, buy me this type of ribbon as you're heading home. Then we're even. Are you okay with that?」
 
 v00an0234
 アンジ「O, okay. Thank you...」
 As I thanked her, I accepted the wallet and the memo that she was offering me.
 st03_a04
 v03wa0889
 ワカバ「No problem, no problem. Then, I'll leave it to you―」
 As I watched Wakaba head back the way we'd come with a spring in her step, I bowed my head once more.
 Wakaba might be a better person than I had thought.

 After finishing breakfast, Light came to me as I was helping clean up.
 
 v01be0335
 ベル「Sure. After I finish washing this, I'll join you at the table.」
 I quickly finished my work, and head to where Light is.
 v01be0336
 ベル「Thanks for waiting. What is it?」
 st05_a03
 v05li0570
 ライト「...Well. I'm not sure how to say it...」
 It seemed like he was having trouble putting it into words. Had Wakaba asked him to do something too?
 
 v01be0337
 ベル「Could it be about the play?」
 st05_a06
 v05li0571
 ライト「Ah, n, no, though I've also thought about that.」
 v01be0338
 ベル「...By ‘also,’ do you mean you have something else to ask?」
 st05_a04
 v05li0572
 ライト「Yeah, I don't know which to talk about first, but the play is the main topic.」
 v01be0339
 ベル「You can start with whichever topic you like.」
 But saying that might just confuse him more,
 v01be0340
 ベル「―If it's possible, choose whichever one is easier for you.」
 
 st05_a00
 v05li0573
 ライト「Then, I'll start with the play. Fa, are you going to participate?」
 v01be0341
 ベル「I still haven't been able to decide. But it's about time I gave her an answer, I guess.」
 
 st05_a06
 v05li0574
 ライト「Hmm, I see...」
 v01be0342
 ベル「Light, are you participating?」
 st05_a04
 v05li0575
 ライト「I guess. It's not easy to say no to Sis, after all. Also, she said I could play a soldier.」
 
 Judging by his tone and expression, it seemed like Light was uncertain about acting as well.
 
 st05_a01
 v05li0576
 ライト「If it's okay with you, let's stand on the stage together, Fa.」
 v01be0343
 ベル「U, um...」
 st05_a08
 v05li0577
 ライト「I'm concerned about Sis's ability to finish her script, but it does look interesting.」
 If it weren't for the issue of singing, I would have agreed readily.
  But with such a great responsibility being thrust at me, it was hard to decide.
 v01be0344
 ベル「...Then, what was the other thing you wanted to ask?」
 Though it was unkind to Light, I avoided answering his question by changing the subject.
 st05_a10
 v05li0578a
 ライト「...Ah, you know. This might be a weird question― but, Fa, now that you've met Angelina... what do you think of her?」
 
 v01be0345
 ベル「Miss Angelina? What do you mean by that?」
 
 As an actress?
 Or does he mean her personality?
  Either way, I haven't talked to her much, so it's difficult for me to answer.
 st05_a11
 v05li0579
 ライト「...Er, as a girl.」
 v01be0346
 ベル「As a girl?」
  That's even more difficult.
 v01be0347
 ベル「(―I'm a Sister, after all. I can't hope to become like Angelina in the future.)」
 
 
 
 
 Father said before that Sisters will never experience a significant change in appearance.
 
 st05_a03
 v05li0580
 ライト「Hmm, was that too strange of a question?」
 v01be0348
 ベル「I might be able to answer if you ask in a more understandable way.」
 st05_a11
 v05li0581
 ライト「T, then. Fa, do you... l-li-li, l-like Angelina?」
 
 So he meant... whether I like her or hate her?
  There are people who I have a hard time dealing with, but I don't think there is anyone whom I hate.
 When it comes to Angelina, how should I answer him―
 v01be0349
 ベル「I like her, I guess?」
 st05_a00
 v05li0582
 ライト「What aspect of her do you like?」
 v01be0350
 ベル「Hmm―. That's a bit difficult, everything, I guess.」
 st05_a03
 After hearing my answer, Light mumbled ‘hmm.’
  It seems like he's himself troubled by that very same question.
 v01be0351
 ベル「Hey, why do you ask that?」
 st05_a02
 v05li0583
 ライト「Er, um. Could you promise to not tell anyone?」
 v01be0352
 ベル「Sure.」
 st05_a11
 v05li0584
 ライト「―I think I might have... fallen in love with Angelina.」
 
 v05li0585
 ライト「―On our first meeting, and our second... my heart kept pounding nonstop.」
 
 v05li0586
 ライト「Even now, I feel so light-headed thinking of her...」
 v01be0353
 ベル「...Light...」
 In the past, I've watched many children from the village grow into adults.
 
 They often discussed things like this with me.
 v01be0354
 ベル「Since I'm a Sister, my emotions might be different from those of humans, but I'm sure what you're feeling is...」
 
 
 
 A symptom of people's interest in the opposite gender when they reach a certain age.
 v01be0355
 ベル「Something similar to love.」
 
 
 st05_a06
 v05li0587
 ライト「...I see. So this is love.」
 
 
 At times like these, I couldn't afford to give him bad advice.
 v01be0356
 ベル「So, be honest with yourself and don't grow troubled over it.」
 That's all I could say.
 st05_a10
 v05li0588
 ライト「...Okay, I got it! Thanks! All right―, I'm going to give it my best!」
 
 
 
 v01be0357

 Light leapt in the direction of the dining hall as if flying.
 I chased after him, but once I turned into the corridor, he had vanished.

 sv003a
 I sat down by a table at the cafe where we had promised to meet, and passed the time by myself.
 v00an0236
 アンジ「...It's been two years.」
 The last time we met was at this sidewalk cafe.

 It's a miracle that I was sitting here at this same table I'd spoken to her at.

 マリオ「But, before I hear this serious matter of yours... I would be happy if you could listen to mine first.」
 
 v00an0240
 アンジ「S, sure!」
 The reason that I was nervous is simple.
 On that day... I was planning to tell her my feelings.
 I had resolved to confess my love to her, even if I were to be rejected.
 v00an0241
 アンジ「So, Lady Marion, you were saying...」
 v08ma0004
 マリオ「...I'm going on a tour to perform next month. That's why I can't come to your school anymore.」
 
 v00an0242
 アンジ「Th, that's... Congratulations!」
 It took a lot of effort for me to say those words of congratulation to my mentor.
 ...But I wasn't able to hide my shock at what I caught sight of following that.
 v00an0243
 アンジ「...Ah...」
 Upon the ring finger of her left hand, there was a simple yet shining ring.
  Even I knew what that signified.
 v08ma0005
 マリオ「Before I decided to tour, there were many people who gave me their support.」
 v08ma0006
 マリオ「―Among them, there was a person whose passion stood out...」
 v08ma0007
 マリオ「He recognized me not just as an actress, but as a woman.」
 The words which accompanied that ring shattered my naive hope.
  ...Still, even now, I don't feel that she betrayed me.
 At that time, my mentor had known that I had something to say―
 
 v00an0244
 アンジ「(―But she still left without asking me about that...)」
 v00an0245
 アンジ「Ah, let me pay the bill today.」
 v08ma0008

 v00an0246
 アンジ「But, at least let me do it today for the sake of congratulating you...」
 v08ma0009

 アンジ「Ah, Lady Marion!」
 Arriving like a breeze, my mentor sat down on the seat across from me. She hasn’t changed in two years... she’s still so beautiful.
 ev008a
 As she sat before me, elegantly sipping her tea, I wondered how close I was to her now...
 
 v00an0248
 アンジ「(―To the mentor whom I admire so, Marion Curie.)」
 After putting on many successful performances, she slowly built up a reputation, and is now quite a famous actress.
 
 Occasionally, I saw her on television giving an interview, but being in front of the actual person―
 
 v00an0249
 アンジ「(―I can't be even compared to her.)」
 I wonder whether it’s sad, to feel so defeated by the difference between us.

 アンジ「That's not the case at all! I was really happy to be able to talk to you yesterday.」
 
 v08ma0013
 マリオ「...How about now, then?」
 Mischievously, my mentor repeated the question that she had asked earlier.
 v00an0252
 アンジ「...Of, of course I am.」
 v08ma0014
 マリオ「You may say that, but you're putting on quite a scary face, my dear.」
 v00an0253
 アンジ「Really? I didn't meant to do that.」
 
 v08ma0015
 マリオ「How should I put it―? It's like you've got a target in your sights, ...and if there's an opportunity, you would shoot it, just like that.」
 
 
 v00an0254
 アンジ「...I'm sorry.」
 v08ma0016
 マリオ「Oh, I don't really mind. It's like you're facing off with a rival. It feels a bit exciting.」
 
 My mentor gave me a wink and a smile.
 ev008e
 v00an0255
 アンジ「...I never thought of you as a rival. Lady Marion, you're beyond my reach now. I'll never catch up...」
 
 v08ma0017

 v00an0256
 アンジ「...That's...」
 v08ma0018
 マリオ「You don't see me as a rival anymore?」
 v00an0257
 アンジ「That's because...」
 ev008c
 v08ma0019
 マリオ「Is it because you were eliminated from the audition?」
 Faced with her string of questions, I couldn't keep pace and instead reached for the teacup.
 
 Then, after taking a deep breath,
 ev008f
 v00an0258
 アンジ「...Since you already know, please don't ask me so pointedly as that,」
 
  I requested of her.
 v08ma0020

 マリオ「No― way―. Chances like these don't come often, so I'm going to tease you all I want.」
 v08ma0022
 マリオ「―So you can be depressed as much as you like.」
 ev008e
 v00an0260
 アンジ「...Eh?」
 v08ma0023
 マリオ「Setbacks are important. Especially for the type of person you are.」
 v00an0261
 アンジ「What do you mean by that?」
 v08ma0024
 マリオ「...Exactly what I said. After experiencing a setback, think about what you are going to do next.」
 
 v08ma0025
 マリオ「―Will you give up here, or do you want to try again? ...Which are you thinking about now?」
 
 v00an0262
 アンジ「I'll try again, of course.」
 v08ma0026
 マリオ「...Yet you're troubled. Troubled about what you should do from now on.」
 Her words pierced through my heart like an arrow.
 ev008f
 v08ma0027
 マリオ「Hey, Angelina. At times like these, you should think back to when you began acting and why.」
 v00an0263
 アンジ「When I began acting?」
 v08ma0028
 マリオ「That's right. When I met you at the school, you were full of spirit, weren't you?」
 
 Back then, mom said it was an ‘investment in my future’ and made me enroll in the school.
 After entering, I found out that everyone was better than me, even though we were in the same class. I was frantic to catch up.
 v08ma0029
 マリオ「Well, I'm not saying you have to repeat what you've done in the past.」
 v08ma0030
 マリオ「I just wanted you to remember back when you first started, so you can find what you need to do now.」
 
 ...What I need to do now.
 v08ma0031
 マリオ「I believe that there are many chances. Small ones and big ones.」
 
 v08ma0032
 マリオ「―Well, of course, anyone would be tempted by the bigger ones.」
 v08ma0033
 マリオ「But if you had one chance and didn't succeed, and gave up because of it, don't you think that would be a waste?」
 v00an0264
 アンジ「...That's right.」
 v08ma0034
 マリオ「You know, I hope that bit by bit you can catch up with me.」
 I digested her words, one at a time.
 I knew that I couldn't aim for the sky if I didn't have solid ground under my feet. I knew that two years ago.
 But right now, as I tried to rebuild my confidence, shattered by the audition results―
 v00an0265
 アンジ「(―That's what is shaking my ground right now.)」
 v08ma0035
 マリオ「...Mmph. Somehow, this is dull.」
 v00an0266
 アンジ「Huh?」
 v08ma0036
 マリオ「Just because your mentor gave you something to think about, you became so quiet.」
 v00an0267
 アンジ「No, no way! I was just listening earnestly to everything you said, and thinking about it...」
 
 v08ma0037
 マリオ「Ah, really! That's why I'm saying it's dull―」
 
 v00an0268
 アンジ「...La, Lady Marion, please calm down.」
 Even though I liked that childish aspect of her, I didn't think she should show it off in public.
 
 v00an0269
 アンジ「(―Somehow, she kind of resembles Wakaba.)」
 v08ma0038
 マリオ「That's why I hate hard-working honor students. You should rely on your wits more.」
 v00an0270
 アンジ「You say that, but you're...」
 ev008c
 v08ma0039
 マリオ「What's wrong with me? Both of my parents are actors, so I received special education. Does that bother you?」
 
 
 v00an0271
 アンジ「I never said anything like that! I know that you've achieved what you have because of hard work!」
 
 
 v08ma0040
 マリオ「...Ufufu. Thank you for following me up. You're so kind, Angelina. That's why I like you.」
 
 v00an0272
 アンジ「...La, Lady Marion...」
 Her sudden compliments stopped my thoughts short.
 v08ma0041
 マリオ「My, my, your face is so red. What's wrong―?」
 v00an0273
 アンジ「...Whether you like me or hate me... don't talk about such things so casually!」
 
 v08ma0042
 マリオ「Ufufu. I'm sorry. You have someone you like now, don't you?」
 v00an0274
 アンジ「Eh? I never said anything like that...」
 
 v08ma0043
 マリオ「...Oh, am I mistaken? Oh well, forget it.」
 
 Marion avoided my eyes, and picked up her teacup.
 v08ma0044
 マリオ「―So, what are you planning to do from now on?」
 ev008e
 v00an0275
 アンジ「...I'm still not sure.」
 v08ma0045
 マリオ「I'll ask in more detail. Don't you have any specific goals? Are you planning on practicing by yourself until the next audition again?」
 
 v00an0276
 アンジ「...I did think about that before, but right now... Not really.」
 v08ma0046
 マリオ「Is it because you've found another path?」
 At those words of hers, the memory of Wakaba's invitation crossed my mind.
 v00an0277
 アンジ「(―What should I do...)」
 After thinking a little, I decided to tell her.

 マリオ「Yeah, of course. That's the theater festival at Moosgrun, right? It sounds fun! Since it's a festival, there will be stands too, right?」
 
 
 
 
 So that's what she meant by ‘interesting...’
 v00an0279
 アンジ「So, Lady Marion, what do you think?」
 v08ma0049

 v00an0280

  Whether it was a good thing or a bad thing for me.

 v00an0281
 アンジ「...Ugh.」
 v08ma0051
 マリオ「But, it might be a chance.」
 v00an0282
 アンジ「You really think so?」
 v08ma0052
 マリオ「To cry as Christina, to laugh as Christina. If you think you're up for it, why not accept her offer?」
 
 ...In the end, Marion never gave me a clear answer about what I should do.
 She must think that I should make the final decision myself.
 ev008b
 v08ma0053
 マリオ「...Okay! Truly a shame, but it's about time. I have a date with my husband after this.」
 
 
 As she said that, she readjusted her hat.

 アンジ「Your husband is... Mister Fabio, right?」
 v08ma0054
 マリオ「...Yeah. I quarreled with him not long ago. But he said he wanted to meet me no matter what, so it's no use.」
 
 She had a resigned expression, but I knew she wasn't truly upset.
 Fabio Grey, that famous eccentric, was a busy person.

 マリオ「...Ufufu, that girl.」
 st08_c00
 She's changed a lot in the two years I haven't seen her.
 I remember the first time when I met Angelina... Back when I visited that school as a special lecturer.
 As everyone was focused on practicing earnestly, I noticed one girl who stood out.
 Even though that child was practicing just as diligently, there was something different about her.
 black450
 By chance, my eyes met hers, and she came and addressed me.
 st00_d08
 v00an0288
 アンジ「...Um, may I ask... an elementary question?」
 Angelina inquired, embarrassed.
 It didn't seem like she had anyone else to talk with, so after I answered her once, she came the next day and the day after to ask me more questions.
 
 I heard about her in more detail after two months working at that school.
 From the evaluation of the role she acted in the entrance examination, she had entered the top class― 
 
 But she confessed that she had never learned any of the basics, and just did it by observing the other children.
 
 Her appearance and voice were good.
  She was hardworking, very competitive, and had an exceptional memory.
 She didn't always try to be the center of attention, and had a charm that attracted others.
 
 black450
 But with her total lack of experience, her zeal only went to waste and was rather unsettling besides.

 マリオ「...It must be hard for her. Nobody's perfect, after all.」
 Angelina's the type who wants to succeed no matter what.
 That's why, she might bloom into a ‘flower’ in an instant.
 ...But, if that actually happens.
  If she doesn't have the experience she needs to maintain her confidence...
 She'll just be an ‘early bloomer’ that will get a moment of attention, then wither soon after.

 v08ma0063
 マリオ「Ufufu, I'm looking forward to it―」
 Anyway, she's taken her first step.
 ...I must work hard as well, so that I won't lose to her.
 As I thought about that, an ostentatious car I remembered well stopped right beside me, and from it emerged a person I hadn't seen in a while.

 It seemed like she was trying to say something difficult, but in the end she just bit her lower lip and went silent.

 Well, I had thought a little about how nice it would be if I were in the same room with Cero on this trip.

 ワカバ「(―How troublesome.)」
 Last night, I hadn't been so conscious of it since Light and Coco were between the two of us, and slept well.
 
 But tonight... Light went to the washroom, and it seemed like he pushed me to the middle of the bed when he came back.
 
 ...Well, it's okay if it's Coco beside me... Just as I thought that, I saw it was actually Cero beside me!

 All right, let's give it a try!

 It's not like I had meant to scold Wakaba.
 But I got too caught up in the moment, and said something I shouldn't have.
 In result, our conversation ended in failure.

 Assuming that I accept her request to perform in the theater festival, there will be times where conflict arises between me and Wakaba.
 But if we are afraid to argue, nothing will ever get started.

 Wakaba had already left, her shoulders drooping. She's probably heading back to her own room.
 I tiptoed back into the house quietly.

 It's possible that they'll come out from the dining hall after they finish talking, so I decided not to go to my room and instead went back outside.

 Being asked like that made me remember what happened in the afternoon, when Lady Marion had suggested I decide for myself.

 And so I said the same words to Belle.

 v00an0368

 st01_a05

 v00an0376
 アンジ「It's fine. This place doesn't belong to anyone. Since you say that, I'm using this place for myself of my own accord too.」
 
 It's night at the moment.
  ...A stage different from that of the afternoon appeared in front of my eyes.
 v00an0377
 アンジ「Can you dance?」
 st01_a04

 I guided her body towards mine, and quietly began the steps of a dance.
 v00an0379

 v01be0387
 ベル「Ah, ah, I'm sorry. I stepped on your foot.」

 v00an0380
 アンジ「Ufufu. I know that even if you don't tell me. After all, there's no one else dancing here at the moment... just you, and me.」

 v00an0381

 v01be0389
 ベル「...Okay.」
 ev010d
 v00an0382
 アンジ「That's right, that feels better. Just follow my lead.」
 Slowly, we danced together, the two of us.
  And then, without knowing whose decision it was, we came to a stop.
 v01be0390
 ベル「Miss Angelina, do you... want to hear my song?」
 ev010e
 As I'd had a feeling that she would ask that question, I nodded wordlessly.
 v01be0391
 ベル「...I still don't think I'll be able to sing right now. But, I'll... work hard for your sake.」
 
 v00an0383
 アンジ「Thank you. But, I'm not the only person... anticipating your song.」
 
 v01be0392
 ベル「...Eh?」
 v00an0384
 アンジ「Don't forget about Wakaba, too.」
 v01be0393
 ベル「...Yes.」
 Whether to participate in the play or not was Belle's own decision.
 ...But giving up, without knowing there are people anticipating her performance, would be truly sad.
 v01be0394
 ベル「If I'm able to sing, will the play... be a success?」
 ev010e
 v00an0385
 アンジ「I don't know. But―」
 Even though I wanted Belle to decide for herself, I had to tell her my true feelings.
 v00an0386
 アンジ「―If you aren't there, I don't think the play will even be able to start.」
 ...I knew saying that was unfair.
 v01be0395
 ベル「...Miss Angelina, are you going to participate in Wakaba's play?」
 ev010f
 v00an0387
 アンジ「......Well, what do you think I should do?」
 Facing my question,
 v01be0396
 ベル「That's something you should decide for yourself, Miss Angelina.」
  Belle began, then said with firm resolve,
 v01be0397
 ベル「But, if it's possible... I would like to perform alongside you.」
 
 ev010e
 v00an0388
 アンジ「(―Well, that goes for me too...)」
 First, I have to apologize to Wakaba.
 After that, there are many other things I have to do.
 v00an0389
 アンジ「My turn to perform is just beginning... isn't it?」
 v01be0398
 ベル「What is just beginning?」
 v00an0390
 アンジ「...No, it's nothing.」
 ev010j
 As my eyes gazed into the night sky, the moon watching over us caressed my face with its pearly light.
 Though now our dance is lit by but a dim crescent, someday, under a spotlight as brilliant as the full moon, we will surely...

 As Belle's singing escaped her lips, our voices joined in a graceful harmony, and we continued to dance through this time - a time meant for us alone.

 Last night, I was abruptly woken up by Wakaba, who had wanted to talk to me about her quarrel with Angelina.
 
 From there, the conversation evolved into us discussing what she could do to make up to Angelina.
 We stayed in the dining hall, talking, until Nicola came by and saw us. By the time we made it back to our room, it was already light out.
 
 ...Thanks to all of that, now I'm dead tired.
 st03_a02

 ワカバ「Cero! Listen, listen!」
 
 Even though we got the same amount of sleep, Wakaba is somehow still as energetic as ever.

 st03_a04
 v03wa0929
 ワカバ「Um, there's good news, and there's more good news! Which do you want to hear first?」
 
 If I say ‘Whichever,’ it'll definitely ruin her good mood.
 「...Let's start with the second one, then.」
 「...Let's start with the first one, then.」
 「...Do whatever you want.」
 v04ce0832
 セロ「...Let's start with the first one, then.」
 In any case, it makes the most sense to go in order.
 v04ce0833
 セロ「...Let's start with the second one, then.」
 Since she specifically asked me to pick which one I wanted to hear first, I'll choose the latter.
 v03wa0930
 ワカバ「Well, it doesn't really matter which one we start with ― they're both about Angelina!」
 
 ...Sorry, but I'd like to know why you bothered letting me choose.
 v04ce0834
 セロ「...Do whatever you want.」
 As I rubbed my eyes, heavy with sleep, my words came out tinged with protest.
 st03_a02
 v03wa0931
 ワカバ「That's boring! Can't you at least try to play along?」
 
 v04ce0835
 セロ「...I'd like to play along, but I'm too tired to since I didn't get much sleep.」
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa0932
 ワカバ「...Ah, s, sorry...」
 After realizing it was her own fault, she apologized morosely.
 For me, the simple fact that she realized it was her fault was more than enough already.
 v04ce0836
 セロ「So, what's that good news you wanted to tell me?」
  I got our conversation back on track.
 st03_a01
 v03wa0933
 ワカバ「...Well, first of all, it's about Angelina!」
 v04ce0837
 セロ「...Did you two make up?」
 st03_a02
 v03wa0934
 ワカバ「That's right! ...Wait, why did you get to say that!」
 v04ce0838
 セロ「Sorry, it just came out. So, did she agree to participate in the play?」
 After I said that, I realized...
 Maybe that was the second piece of good news.
 v04ce0839
 セロ「(―I messed up!)」
 Expecting to get walloped, I bowed my head and steeled myself for the incoming fist.
 But, instead, Wakaba―
 st03_a03
 v03wa0935
 ワカバ「...She said she wanted to put the decision ‘on hold’ for now.」
  said that in a depressed voice.
 v04ce0840
 セロ「...I see.」
 That was unexpected. I don't know if it's good or bad.
 Anyway, I have to quickly get the conversation moving again or she's just going to stay depressed.
 st03_a00
 v03wa0936
 ワカバ「The second piece of good news... Well, I guess you've already said it.」
 v04ce0841
 セロ「Eh?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0937
 ワカバ「Belle said she's willing to participate in the play!」
 v04ce0842
 セロ「...That's great!」
 st03_a01
 v03wa0938
 ワカバ「...Yeah!」
 v04ce0843
 セロ「Did she suddenly change her mind this morning and agree to it? Or is this the hard-earned result of all your private negotiations?」
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa0939
 ワカバ「Nope. Even though I planned to convince her, in the end I never once got around to it while we've been in the Blue Capital.」
 v04ce0844
 セロ「―I see. So that means... maybe she came to that decision by herself after thinking it over?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0940
 ワカバ「Hmm... anyway, it worked out in the end!」
 It was so like Wakaba to come to a conclusion like that.

 v00an0395
 アンジ「Come on, don't go to sleep!」
 It's been a long time since we've joked around like this.
 Lately, because I need to rehearse and go to my job, I've been leaving early in the morning and not coming back until late at night. As a result, I'm not spending as much time with the kids as I used to.
 v13pa0009

 I cut short the useless chatter and got back on topic.

 v13pa0011
 パウラ「―But, there are only three single rooms, right?」
 The three rooms Paula's talking about are Mom's, mine and Lulu's.
 v13pa0012
 パウラ「Now that I've thought about it, it's impossible for me to have my own room unless we remodel the house, isn't it?」
 In the past, a room would be given to whoever got the most votes among the children, but now it seems that the kids think getting their own room is impossible.
 
 
 v00an0398
 アンジ「...If that's the case, should I reserve my room for you?」
 v13pa0013

 アンジ「...Hey, Mom, I have something to talk to you about, so I'm coming in.」
 Anne, who had just come back from her part time job, said that without even greeting me first.
 She seemed unusually nervous, anxiously glancing to see if anybody was passing by.
 Judging by her behavior, I could guess what it was that she wanted to talk to me about.

 So I delayed the talk for a little bit.
 It might be better to listen to her right now.

 To help her solve those, I would also need time to prepare.

 ニコラ「...Anyway, that girl's really grown up.」
 The children who come to this home have all experienced different ways of life.
 Some had parents who died at early age, some ran away from troubled households.
 
 No matter what kind of children they are, once I decide to raise them, they become part of my family.
 I take upon myself the responsibility to watch over them until they become adults and enter society.
 I truly believe that there's nothing else that I, who was separated from my husband and kicked out of the house by my son, can do.
 
 ...I've been living my life like this for years, and I'm not changing my path now.

 After dinner, the children went back to their own rooms.
 The whole day, I've been wondering ‘how should I tell Mom?’ and ‘how can I explain it?’
 In the end, I just decided ‘It'll work out somehow.’
 No matter how much I fret over my problems, now that I've made my decision I need to take action.
 If it turns out that I can't handle it, then I'll deal with that when the time comes.

 This is the place where the kids all play together on rainy days.
 Spotting the piano in the corner, I silently headed towards it.
 ev009a
 v10ni0114

 v00an0402

 ニコラ「Hmph, ever since that incident everyone has been yelling ‘Hurray, Big Sis!’ Aren't you proud of yourself?」
 
 ev009c
 v00an0403
 アンジ「Of course... not.」
 It's already been five years since that happened.
 When we voted on what we wanted, the idea to ‘Put a piano in the game room’ always came in first.
 
 But, back then Mom kept ignoring everyone's wishes, and rejected the request over and over again.
 
 Who can actually play the piano anyway?
  Don't you think it'd just make the neighbors complain that you're being too noisy?
  I'm fine with buying it, but wouldn't it just end up covered with dust?
 ...After hearing those excuses, I started arguing with Mom in front of everyone.
 v00an0404
 アンジ「I'll take care of it somehow!」
 Now that I think about it, that wasn't much of an answer.
 I could have told her we would practice playing the piano as a hobby, and make sure to keep it quiet whenever we used it.
 And if we did buy it, we could keep a record of how many times we used it per week.
 And then, after days of nonstop pestering, Mom finally caved in and bought one. It was―
 v00an1081
 アンジ「...A smaller piano than we had expected.」
 ev009d
 v10ni0116
 ニコラ「What's wrong? Are you still unsatisfied with it?」
 
 v00an0406

 At that time, we were filled with joy.
 We thought that it was better than any of the pianos we'd seen in the shops lining the streets.
 v00an0407
 アンジ「...Buying that wasn't easy, wasn't it?」
 v10ni0117
 ニコラ「Who knows, I've forgotten all about it.」
 v00an0408
 アンジ「You had to renovate the room so it'd be soundproof, right?」
 v10ni0118
 ニコラ「I might have.」
 ...Mom has always been dodging my questions like this.
  She was always thinking about the children, and pushing herself hard for their sake.
 But at the same time, she avoids taking credit and laughs whenever she says something mischievous.
 This is the Mom I love the most.
 v10ni0119

  It's actually the exact opposite of that.
 v00an0410
 アンジ「I'm thinking of becoming a stage actress.」

 v10ni0120
 ニコラ「...Why are you saying that now? I've been opposed to that for such a long time, there's no way you didn't know.」

 ev009e
 v10ni0121
 ニコラ「Oh, how so?」
 v00an0412
 アンジ「...In order to become an actress, I'm leaving home.」
 Even though I'd wanted to explain it properly, in the end, I just blurted out my intention.
 Mom glanced at me.
 v10ni0122

  And murmured that.
 v10ni0123

 v00an0413

 v10ni0124

 v00an0414
 アンジ「I can't do that. I have to become independent just like the other older kids.」
 
 v10ni0125
 ニコラ「...That's a good resolution. This way, the preparations I've made up until today will all have been worth it.」
 
 v00an0415
 アンジ「...?」
 v10ni0126
 ニコラ「Don't mind me, go on. So, how do you plan to become a stage actress?」
 First, I told her about Wakaba's plan to participate in the theater festival in Moosgrun.
 And then, I told her that I was invited to be one of their members.
 v10ni0127
 ニコラ「Hmm. So you're going on a journey with Wakaba and the others?」
 v00an0416
 アンジ「Yup. I'll be able to somehow, just barely, pay the travel expenses with the money I've saved up.」
 v10ni0128
 ニコラ「Heh, that looks like quite an amount. I never knew.」
 v00an0417
 アンジ「That's because I followed your advice and saved up without wasting any of it.」
 And then, I told her the details - about how their group doesn't have all the roles filled yet, and how Wakaba's script is still incomplete.
 v10ni0129
 ニコラ「That sounds like quite a joke. What about your living expenses until then?」
 v00an0418
 アンジ「Well, Wakaba said that she would handle that as part of my ‘performance fee.’」
 
 v10ni0130
 ニコラ「So your debut role will be a charity performance.」
 v00an0419
 アンジ「That's fine, my goal is just to get on stage. I have to make up for my lack of experience, or else...」
 v10ni0131
 ニコラ「Ah, I got it, I got it. No need to explain it all. If you've already made your decision, then I won't object.」
 
 Mom shook the cup in her hand and nodded two, three times.
 v00an0420
 アンジ「...This might seem strange for me to ask, but is it really okay?」
 v10ni0132
 ニコラ「It's not like you're the first one. All the children in the past have had similar conversations with me.」

 I haven't told Mom about that yet.

 v00an0426
 アンジ「Ehhh!?」
 v10ni0138

 v00an0427
 アンジ「So, what was the point of our conversation just now? You were listening to me even though you knew my plans already?」
 
 v10ni0139
 ニコラ「Ah, that's right. I wanted to see whether you'd be honest with me.」
 
 ...I didn't expect it to turn out this way.
 v10ni0140
 ニコラ「If I hadn't known, I wouldn't have just said ‘Oh, I see,’ or something like that and accepted it so easily, right?」
 
 Mom lifted her head and smiled, though she still sighed softly.
 v10ni0141
 ニコラ「Well, some things just happen too quickly. I didn't have time to arrange a proper farewell gift, forgive me.」
 
 v00an0428
 アンジ「Of course I don't mind, don't worry about it. I'm the one who should apologize...」
 As I bowed my head, Mom handed me something.
 v00an0429

  A bank book?
 v10ni0142
 ニコラ「That's all the money you've earned from your part time job up until now.」
 v00an0430
 アンジ「Looks like I've been working pretty hard.」
 The amount of money I gave to Mom every month was recorded there.
 v10ni0143
 ニコラ「Well, normally I'd subtract your allowance up until now from the amount you're getting back, but I'll give you a bonus. Take it.」
 
 v00an0431
 アンジ「Eh!? How could I, this money is supposed to be for the home...」
 
 v10ni0144
 ニコラ「That's right. And when children leave home, I give it back to them. I've always done this for all the kids.」
 
 v10ni0145
 ニコラ「―You're going to be independent from now on, aren't you?」
 v10ni0146
 ニコラ「These are the preparations you've made for this moment.」
 v00an0432
 アンジ「...Mom...」
 In truth, that was supposed to be the money used to support the home.
 We can't depend on government funding if we want to keep the orphanage going... it's just not enough.
 Even though that's the case, she still―
 v10ni0147
 ニコラ「Oh my, spare me that teary face of yours. At times like this, you should just casually thank me to show your gratitude.」
 v00an0433
 アンジ「Thank you, Mom. I'll use this money wisely.」
 But there was no way I could convey my thanks as easily as that. This bank book has a weight no words could bear.
 v10ni0148

 v00an0434

 I tilted my head and tried, but I couldn't remember anything that seemed relevant.

 v10ni0154

 アンジ「Everyone!
 Looks like the stuff we've been waiting for is here!」
 As we were doing rehearsals at the theater we borrowed, the stage clothing that we've been waiting so long for had finally arrived.
 
 These clothes were all rental costumes chosen based on the information Cero had gathered in the library.
 
 According to Cero, in the historical play ‘The Angel's Guidance’, each character is traditionally associated with a color of their own.
 
 For example, Princess Christina's color is white.
 Whereas the traitor, Ein, wears the opposite color- black. Cero had told me this was so the audience could identify the characters easily.
 
 
 st00_c00
 v00an1391
 アンジ「Here, this is Cero's... and this must be Light's.」
 As Angelina is busy distributing everyone's costumes, I realized that there were two people missing from our group.

 v01be1145

 st00_c00

 アンジ「Tonino is playing multiple roles, right? So that all of his costumes fit him perfectly, they both went there together.」
 
 
 st00_c04
 v00an1394
 アンジ「She was fussing over Tonino and saying ‘not like this, not like that’, so they're taking a while.」
 
 st00_c00
 v00an1395
 アンジ「―Not just his clothes, she wants to get the wig perfect as well.」
 I couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Tonino's hair becoming various shapes and colors.
 Personally, though, I think that he looks the best as the way he is...
 st00_c01
 v00an1396
 アンジ「Alright, everyone, go change into your costumes in the dressing room.」
 black450
 As expected of a real theater, there were many individual dressing rooms. Everyone went into their own room which had their name hung on it, and started changing.
 
 From Light's room, which was beside mine,
 v05li0736
 ライト「Uooh―!
 This costume looks so cool―!」
  I heard him shout, and smiled faintly.
 
 st01_d00
 v01be1146
 ベル「(―I wonder what my costume looks like?)」
 The costume of the most popular angel in ‘The Angel's Guidance’ ―the Schwester.
 
 The scarf that was to wrap around my neck and the wing on my back was black in color.
 st01_e00
 It had the same shape as the scarf I always wore... did Wakaba choose it because of that?
 
 The costume fits me perfectly too, that's quite admirable.
 After looking myself over in the mirror, I left the dressing room, descended from the stage, and headed for the audience seating.
 
 st01_e06
 v01be1147

 It reminded me of the reflection I'd seen in the window in the Red Capital. 
 And from Efa's memories, a sense of nostalgia for those days arose.
 st01_e05
 v01be1148
 ベル「(―At that time, Efa was also playing the role of an angel who served the queen...)」
 Even though the story of our plays was different, Efa and I had surpassed the barrier of time, and we were both playing the same role of the ‘Angel’.
 
 black450
 v01be1149
 ベル「(―Let's go, Efa.)」
 I said that to the other me, who slept within my heart, and left the dressing room.

 And then I went to where Angelina was waiting. She seemed surprised that I was the first to be back.
 
 st00_c01
 v00an1397
 アンジ「......It really looks good on you.」
 v01be1150

 Faced with her smile and her words of praise, my face had turned red before I knew it, and as I was about to bow my head to hide my embarrassment―
 
 st00_c02
 v00an1398
 アンジ「...Alright, keep your eyes straight, and don't look away.」
 v01be1151

 She placed her finger upon my chin, and thus made me raise my head again.

 v00an1399

 ...She was definitely right.
 I tried my best to bear it and look Angelina in the eye.
 st00_c01
 v00an1400

 When I turned to look behind me, I saw Silvia striding towards us with a broad, knightly gait.

 v00an1401
 アンジ「What do you think, Belle?」
 v01be1152

 Those were my honest thoughts.
 Even though she was a woman who was completely unlike Dua, I still felt that the two of them share some similarities...
 
 
 
 v01be1153

 face00_c08

 Or is that what...」
 v01be1154
 ベル「...
 
 It's what we both think.」

 Angelina nodded silently in agreement with my answer.
 
 But, even though we had praised Silvia, she still kept on adjusting her hem and sleeves, as if concerned with their fit.

 シルヴ「...Dua the knight, eh...」
 face00_c01
 v00an1403
 アンジ「...Don't tell us that you're not happy playing the knight, okay, Silvia? If even someone as perfect for this role as you ran away, this play is without hope.」
 
 Even though she said that flippantly, I knew those were her true thoughts.
 ...That's because it was rare of Angelina to compliment others.
 st06_b04
 v06si0462
 シルヴ「Well, I do think knights are pretty cool, though...」
 She scratched her head, and grinned as if she appreciated the flattery.
  But, she seemed to be quite concerned about the prop she was holding in her hand.

 v06si0463

  she asked Angelina.

 Do you think there's something more suitable than a sword?」

 v06si0718

 With a hopeless expression on her face, Ange looked towards the ceiling, leaving the task of persuading Silvia upon my shoulders.

 v01be1155

 face00_c08
 v00an1407
 アンジ「Dear me, can you really succeed in the role of the knight like that?」
 Angelina sighed, and just as Silvia was about to retort, the sound of metal clanging came from across the stage.
 
 
 As the three of us turned to look at the source of that sound, we found it was―
 face00_c00

 v06si0465
 シルヴ「Ahaha, Light, that's fantastic on you!」

 It was Light, wearing a helmet.
 face00_c01

 アンジ「Well don't you make a cute little soldier.」
 As they both patted the top of his helmet, Light came and stood in front of me,

  and asked.
 v01be0621

 Even though he did make a rather small soldier, in truth Light is a boy who's very dependable when the time comes. I understood that well.

 Light smiled happily as he stood side by side with us. 
 And then, the final person to appear was Cero, who didn't look like himself at all―

 face00_c05

 Even though it had been a little rocky, Silvia and I had enjoyed our stay here in Moosgrun.
 
 Well, it's my first time here, after all.
 I had wanted to come and visit this place a few times in the past, since I was interested in the theater festival back then, but had forgotten all about it.
 
 So this means I have to thank those guys that invited me, right?
 
 Of course, I hope they don't forget that they've caused me quite some trouble too.

 So Silvia and I had both gotten the time wrong.

 For a moment, I had thought that he was talking about the shower, so I swiftly denied it.

 So I asked them to wait for me as I hurried back to my hotel room.

 As I entered the bathroom, my plan was to just take a brief shower, but then I changed my mind and thought I might as well take a bath.
 
 With that thought in mind, I filled the bathtub with water, and just as I got in to enjoy my quick bath―

 I heard that voice as I was inside it.
 What Cero had said earlier echoed inside my head.

 Nothing wrong with doing this and that, even in the bathroom in the early morning.

 Even though it was already past noon, only by indulging myself in the bathtub while the sky is still bright can I start my day.
 
 This wasn't anything extravagant, but spending my time carefreely like this was my greatest pleasure.
 Especially when someone had already filled the tub with water for me, which saved me time getting in.

 When he had told me to join in... for a moment I thought it wasn't a bad idea.
 But that would make us both sweaty, which would defeat the purpose of bathing, and we might even continue it in bed.

 I'm sure Tonino must have been fantasizing about that while he was in the shower.

 He really liked this hat, if I accidentally ruined it―
 v06si0368

 That question suddenly occurred to me.
 Well, he probably wouldn't, since he's crazy for me.
 It's not that I'm being overconfident, but I understand quite clearly how he feels about me.
 ...That's why,
 no matter what I do that might make him unhappy, I've always thought that he would forgive me.

 Tonino had shyly given me one of a matching pair of rings, then I'd told him that I'd lost mine the day after.
 
 In the end, all he'd done was shrug his shoulders.

 I wonder what kind of person I am to Tonino?

 Even though I said that flippantly, I immediately grew embarrassed about it.

 There's a small hill near Uncle Cero's house. It's the best place to take a nap on a sunny day like this.

 v04ce1285
 セロ「Rather than Wakaba alone... it's more like we're slaves to everyone in the troupe.」
 But for my sister's sake, we had decided on our own to help out with making the set backdrops.
 
 Well, the real reason was more that we wanted to avoid Sis, since she'd gotten mad after Tonino and Silvia came really late to the rehearsal.

 You don't like being a soldier?」
 I'd definitely have made more a fuss if she had made me wear something weird, but since she'd decided on this soldier costume on a snap, I didn't have any other choice.

 v05li0703
 ライト「...Well, it's not like I don't. I guess I do like it? Especially this helmet, it's actually pretty cool.」
 
 After the play ends, I'll ask if I can keep this helmet as a souvenir... I know that's impossible, but I still want to ask.
 
 ―Well, it's all thanks to Uncle Cero's hard work in the library that Sis was able to choose such great costumes.
 
 But that's not the problem.
 v05li0704
 ライト「Still, not only do I not have much screen time, there's hardly any lines for me to speak either.」
 I admitted what was leaving me dissatisfied.
 The only parts where I appear are the starting scene, and some nonsense in another scene later on.

 v04ce1287

 While he pointed out the spots that I'd painted wrong, Cero talked about what had happened as we were practicing our lines together with Tonino.

 トニー「Well now, why don't we practice our lines together?」
 At the start, he'd said it was just for us men to stick together... but once he picked up the script and we started practicing our lines, he kept bombarding us with criticism.

 st07_d06
 v07to0487
 トニー「Listen, lines aren't read, but spoken on stage.」
 Even though just saying our lines was enough of a challenge, he was already trying to make us into professional actors.
 Since Cero's a serious person, he had more patience and took the rehearsal more seriously than me, but still... repeating the same lines over and over again gets really tiring.
 
 st07_d07
 v07to0170
 トニー「Even though staying accurate to the script is important when you speak, calm down and take it slowly.」
 After repeating our lines countless times,
 st07_d02
 v07to0488
 トニー「If you still feel it's too hard to say the lines, then you should take it up with the scriptwriter.」
 Tonino said that and pushed the responsibility onto Sis.

 We both laughed as we spoke about that.

 And that hilarious mustache that Cero had been wearing made it even funnier.
 
 v05li0705
 ライト「Uncle Cero, do you really want to say lines on stage that much?」

 ワカバ「...By the way, when are we using that blue sky?」

 And she went on to complain that the backdrop was too small.

 Judging from what Wakaba had said earlier, she'd used some kind of method to exchange the backdrop of the blue sky which she started with... into the castle on display right now?

 シルヴ「It's difficult doing something you're not used to, huh.」
 v00an1435
 アンジ「...Well, then relax a little, and try to perform naturally?」
 I believed that it wasn't that she wasn't taking this seriously enough and failing to act Dua's part, but because she was too concerned with trying to perform well, thus causing her to fail.
 
 v00an1436
 アンジ「I'm not going to force you.」
 Misspeaking a few lines in the real performance isn't a big deal.
 However, Silvia is in quite a few influential scenes. If she makes too many mistakes, it might even disrupt the entire play.

 Now that she mentions it, she had brought Coco to her house the first few times, but at some point, she had started going to Cero's house to talk to her instead.
 
 
 And when Wakaba finally came back at night, she would shut herself inside her room with nothing to be heard of her but the clacking of her typewriter. It had been like that all this while.

 The train we were heading to the next town on was significantly different from the one we had come to the Blue Capital on, which gave me quite a shock.
 
 There was only a corridor on the side facing the platform, and nothing like seats to be seen anywhere.
 But on the other side, there were several doors. It felt like it was a series of rooms all lined up.
 
 I turned around to face Cero, and asked,
 v01be0399

 ...Sleeping train?
  I repeated that word a couple of times in my head before I finally remembered.
 I've heard from tourists who visited Silberg that they came on a train like this.
 
 v01be0401

 st04_a01
 v04ce0849
 セロ「We'll be going straight there. Even though we're in no hurry, it'd be tiresome if we had to find a place to stay the night in the middle of the trip. So I chose this train, which will still be going as we sleep.」
 
 
 It was exactly as Cero said.
 After reaching a stop, we have to unload all our luggage, then load it back up the next morning. That does waste a lot of time and energy.
 
 Especially since I'm much weaker than everyone else, even though Light helps me out carrying my things... I would still feel bad about it.

 セロ「We're going to meet with Rein... the day after the day after tomorrow, right?」

 Last night, after I told Father on the phone that I'd agreed to perform, he said that I needed maintenance before going on such an adventure, so we decided to meet at Aubergine on our way to the White Capital.
 
 
 Even though we both had plenty of flexibility concerning the time of our meeting―

 ‘It's a rare opportunity, so the two lead characters should have time to chat with each other!’ ...Was what Wakaba had suggested.

 After hearing Cero's explanation, Angelina glanced at him suspiciously.
 But, she was the one misunderstanding something here―

 As Cero stared at his ticket in disbelief, I took a look at my ticket as well.

 ―Sleeping Carriage, two nights. Destination, White Capital―
 This was definitely a long way from our planned stop of Aubergine.

 v00an0467
 アンジ「...It's not like I'm angry. If you must know, it's more like I'm despondent.」
 
 After hearing it was Wakaba who'd bought the tickets, my head had drooped.
 
 v00an0468
 アンジ「How in the world did she even get Aubergine and the White Capital mixed up?」
 st01_a04
 v01be0409
 ベル「It's my fault. If I had properly told everyone this morning that we'd be meeting up with Father...」
 
 v00an0469
 アンジ「That's not the problem. Cero let Wakaba buy the tickets because he'd already told her where we'd be stopping, right?」
 
 In the end, she interpreted that as ‘through Aubergine’ or something like that on her own accord, and bought tickets straight to the White Capital!
 
 ...If that's the case, Wakaba was the one at fault.
 v00an0470
 アンジ「A―ah. What a waste of money, paying to take this fancy train all that way past Aubergine.」
 Even though I knew that Wakaba jumped to conclusions once in a while, I would have never expected her to go this far.
 
 I wish she'd be more careful, especially when it comes to financial matters.
 st01_a06
 v01be0410
 ベル「...Um, Miss Angelina. You guys can go straight on to the White Capital before me... How about that?」
 
 v01be0411
 ベル「After meeting my father in Aubergine, I'll join up with you all later. That way, only my share of the travel fee will be wasted.」
 
 v00an0471
 アンジ「There's no way we could do something like that. Denied!」
 Even though she'd suggested it with a radiant smile, we couldn't leave Belle behind just to save some money.
 
 v00an0472
 アンジ「(―But, if there was someone accompanying her...)」
 I realized it'd only cost us two tickets to the White Capital if we did that...
 
 
 This was Wakaba's fault, so she should be the one to accompany Belle, but I don't think I could trust Wakaba not to make things even worse.
 
 If that's the case, it would be either Cero or me staying.
 Cero is the leader whom everyone else depends on, so it seems like I'm the most suitable person to accompany Belle.
 
 v00an0473
 アンジ「...Very well, but I'm going with you.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0412
 ベル「Eh? But that would be bad for you, since you still have to practice for the play.」
 
 
 v00an0474
 アンジ「Wakaba hasn't even completed a synopsis. Besides, the one who needs practice more than I... is you.」
 
 v00an0475

 st01_a07

 v00an0476
 アンジ「So I have to stay with you, so that we can practice whenever we have free time. What do you think?」

 v00an0477
 アンジ「...That's right. You don't want to?」
 st01_a00
 v01be0415
 ベル「Of course not. It's the opposite, I'd be glad if you would. Since it'd be embarrassing to practice in front of everyone... I might not even be able to do anything.」
 
 
 The feeling of being counted on isn't so bad.
 Also, I need to start practicing again before my skills get rusty.
 
 v00an0478
 アンジ「If you're okay with it, how about we start practicing now?」
 st01_a08
 v01be0416
 ベル「Eh? Right here?」
 
 v00an0479
 アンジ「Sure. Since it so happens we're alone together right now.」
 I rose from my seat, took Belle's hand,
 v00an0480
 アンジ「A pleasure to meet you, Schwester.」
  and tried speaking to her.
 st01_a05
 v01be0417
 ベル「...Eh? Ah, oh. I'm the Schwester, right?」
 
 v00an0481
 アンジ「That's right. It seems like Wakaba's script refers to the Sister that way.」
 There's a lot of controversy over the name of the Sister who was with the Princess, but no one ever reached a conclusion.
 
 
 
 v00an0482
 アンジ「...Then, let's try that again. I'll start with the greeting.」
 st01_a06
 v01be0418
 ベル「O, okay!」
 v00an0483
 アンジ「You don't have to be so nervous. No one is a great actor when they first start, after all. Let's just begin by setting the mood.」
 
 I greeted Belle once more while slowly reaching out a hand to her, and awaited her response.
 
 st01_a00
 v01be0419
 ベル「A, a pleasure to meet you... Miss Angelina.」
 v00an0484
 アンジ「That's it. You sounded pretty nervous, but that might make it more realistic. But you're forgetting one important thing.」
 
 st01_a06
 v01be0420
 ベル「What is it?」
 st01_a05
 v00an0485
 アンジ「Right now I'm not Angelina, I'm Her Highness.」
 Even though I couldn't help but laugh saying that, there's no room on stage for such mistakes.
 
 That's why I think we need to become accustomed to our roles from here on.
 
 st01_a11
 v01be0421
 ベル「Er, please let me try again.」
 v00an0486
 アンジ「That's a good attitude. Then, I'm going to start.」
 We repeatedly greeted each other. If another person had seen us, they would definitely think we were weirdos.
 After noticing that Belle's delivery had gotten smoother, I suggested she add gestures to her speech.
 st01_a00
 It might be because she's repeated it countless times, but her nervousness has vanished and her greeting has become very natural.
 v00an0487
 アンジ「...You got it? Now, maintain that natural tone, but try to exaggerate your movements more.」
 
 st01_a06
 v01be0422
 ベル「O, okay. ...A pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.」
 Sadly, her gestures influenced her speech, and she went back to being stiff like she'd been in the beginning.
 
 A clear and natural voice, and movements exaggerated so that they were easy to understand.
 Since trying to do both those at once is difficult, I considered focusing on smoothing out her speech first.
 
 
 v00an0488
 アンジ「Can you still go on?」
 st01_a01

 As we slowly traveled away from the Blue Capital, the view outside changed into rural landscapes and natural scenery.
 In the past, this place was known as the Blue Kingdom, and had prospered because of its governance that focused on trading, rather than agriculture.

 I don't really think it's good to procrastinate, but we'll still be on this train until tomorrow afternoon.

 But it was different from the bed in the sleeping train.
 Not only the bed was different, but the scene in front of my eyes was, too.

 She was in the same room, gazing at my face.

 アンジ「What a relief... I'm really glad you woke up again.」
 v01be0426

 I definitely remember being on board the sleeping train; I'd been in the same room as Angelina, and we'd done a little practicing for the play―
 st00_a00
 v00an0497
 アンジ「...Wait, I'll explain it to you right now.」
 As Angelina said that, she neatly tucked my disheveled blanket back into place, then explained the situation.
 v00an0498
 アンジ「This is Aubergine. We all got off the train as we'd originally planned.」
 v01be0427

 st00_a06
 v00an0499
 アンジ「...I guess you wouldn't. That's because you were unconscious at the time.」
 v01be0428
 ベル「Eh?」
 According to Angelina's explanation―
 It seems like when she'd returned to the room that night, I was already asleep, so she hadn't disturbed me.
 I was still asleep until the next morning, and only opened my eyes when we were almost at Aubergine.
 But it was only natural that I didn't have any memories of that time, since I'd been in a daze and hadn't answered even when someone said my name.
 st00_a00

 アンジ「...In the end, all of us got off the train in Aubergine.」
 I never thought it would turn out like this.
 I felt as if a piece of my life had been cut away, which was a little scary.
 v00an0501
 アンジ「After that, we went into the hotel for the meeting that Cero set up, since he'd talked to you beforehand and... that's it.」
 
 Angelina's explanation had cleared things up for me. Now I knew the source of the problem.
  It was entirely my fault that this had all happened.
 v01be0429

 st00_a05
 v00an0504
 アンジ「Ate too much? Of what?」
 
 v01be0432
 ベル「The tranquilizing Drops.」
 
 
 After practicing with Angelina, I still couldn't calm down, so I used the items that Father had given me.
 
 Those were the leftovers from the Drops that I used on my way to the Blue Capital.
 
 
 v01be0433

 アンジ「So it's like the side effects caused by human medicine?」
 v01be0434

 At that moment, I realized my sense of time was askew.
 v01be0435

 st00_a00
 v00an0506
 アンジ「We got here this afternoon and you were asleep on the train yesterday... So I guess it's been about a day?」
 
 Now I know roughly how long I've been unconscious, and the reason why.
 ...But, I couldn't calm down yet.
 v01be0436
 ベル「(―It never would've occurred to me that I would use the Drop incorrectly.)」
 
 
 
 Not spitting out the old ones before swallowing the new ones... It's the first time I've made that mistake.
  
 
 v01be0437
 ベル「I'm sorry. I don't know how I can apologize to everyone...」
 st00_a01

 v01be0438

 st00_a04
 v00an0508
 アンジ「When we first got here, everyone was squeezing into this room. Since they were getting in the way, I drove them out. Having one person here is more than enough, anyway.」
 
 As I saw her rolled up her sleeves jokingly, I couldn't help but laugh. But if that happened this afternoon...

 st00_a00
 v00an0510
 アンジ「I didn't have anything else to do, and I was reading a book anyway. Don't worry about it. Also, don't apologize, okay?」
 Since she had already predicted what I was going to say, I silently bowed my head.
 Angelina said, ‘Let's wait and see how you do for a while longer, and if you've really recovered, I'll go tell everyone,’ then sat on the chair beside my bed.

 But this time... it would be wise for me to wait for Father to arrive.
 
 st00_a05

  Something like ‘Lovey Dovey Princess and the Doll’ was written on them, which made me feel a little embarrassed.
 
 st00_a00

 Schwester.
 It seems like I'll have to get used to being called that myself.

 Wakaba had said she was hungry, and so we started strolling around, looking about the nearby area.
 
 And the closest building that looked like a restaurant had been... here.
 Judging by all the wine bottles tightly packed on the wall behind the counter, this is probably what they call a ‘tavern.’
 
 Even if I was mistaken, it didn't look like the type of restaurant that focuses on food.

 Two combination plates seemed a bit bland, so I changed one to a salad.
 
 After the dishes we ordered finally arrived, we started digging in and discussed the incident that had happened on the train.

 ワカバ「...I'm sorry, Cero. It was my fault for not listening properly, buying the wrong tickets, and wasting money.」
 
 v04ce0872
 セロ「It's okay, it's fine now.」
  I was at fault too, for not checking.
 v04ce0873
 セロ「Besides...」
 st03_a07
 v03wa0946
 ワカバ「Rather than worrying about that, we should be more concerned about Belle, shouldn't we?」
 v04ce0874
 セロ「...Yeah.」
 I am worried about her, but visiting her right now would just cause more trouble.
 Realizing that, I decided to change the subject.
 v04ce0875
 セロ「...By the way, how's the script going?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa0947
 ワカバ「The script isn't done yet, but I've already finished the outline and handed it over to Anne. She's probably read it by now.」
 
 
 
 Wakaba grinned as she picked up a sausage with her fork.
  ...Seems like she's pretty confident.
 v04ce0876
 セロ「What's it like, generally speaking? At least tell me a bit.」
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa0948
 ワカバ「Well, basically it's a twist in the middle, during the ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ part.」
 The ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ bit that Wakaba mentioned was a separate play nestled inside ‘The Angel's Guidance’ story.
 
 Christina had performed as the first queen of the White Kingdom in that play... it was like a play inside a play.
 
 v03wa0949
 ワカバ「In the castle, where the Red and Blue Kingdom are plotting their conspiracy... The play's focus will be on the love story between Christina and the Schwester!」
 
 
 v04ce0877
 セロ「...Ah, I, I see. With the Schwester, eh...」
 
 I wonder what Belle will think, as the one performing the Schwester?
 st03_a03
 v03wa0950
 ワカバ「You don't like it? But if that weren't the case, then it would be boring.」
 
 v04ce0878
 セロ「Is the original plot's focus on political intrigue no good?」
 
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa0951
 ワカバ「That's just flavoring. It's only to make sure the audience doesn't fall asleep, so just a bit of that is enough.」
 Is it really okay to do that?
 Since she did plan to end the story by portraying Ein as a good person, after all...
 st03_a04
 v03wa0952
 ワカバ「Anyway, the Princess and her Sister are the star duo in my version of the ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ scene.」
 
 
 Seems like she's decided that as the point where her story starts to deviate from the original ‘The Angel's Guidance’.
 
 v03wa0953
 ワカバ「―Close but not too close, far but not too far...」
 As Wakaba became lost in her own imagination, her voice got louder and louder.
 
 The bar was already filled with chatting people, so our conversation wasn't particularly noisy.
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa0954
 ワカバ「...Also! Even though the ambassador from the Blue Kingdom was a gentleman, there were some weird rumors floating around about him.」
 
 
 
 
 st03_a04
 v03wa0955
 ワカバ「In the original ‘The Angel's Guidance’ he was the one who exposed Ein's conspiracy, but in my version it's different―」
 
 I noticed that the people around us had quieted down, and Wakaba's voice was standing out.
 st03_a10
 v03wa0956
 ワカバ「Then in the end he becomes Ein's ally, and stops the troops from the Blue Kingdom! How's that?」
 
 
 v04ce0879
 セロ「...S, stop. Take a look behind you.」
 st03_a05
 v03wa0957
 ワカバ「Huh?」
 Wakaba turned around, realizing that there were people staring at us.
 And noticed that one of them, a drunken old man, was glaring at us.
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa0958
 ワカバ「...Ah, did we get too noisy?」
 v44xx0001
 酔親父「Naw, I thought that was pretty darn interesting.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa0959
 ワカバ「Ah, ahahaha.」
 After hearing the man's thoughts on her play, Wakaba became a little embarrassed. Had she even noticed he was dead drunk?
 
 v44xx0002
 酔親父「By the way, lemme ask ya a question. Did ya think of that story yerself, lass?」
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa0960
 ワカバ「...Yeah, most of it.」
 v44xx0003
 酔親父「Ho―, that's great. Ya have a good imagination. ...So, what happens in the end?」
 
 v44xx0004
 酔親父「Sounded like ya were going to say that the Blue Kingdom's ambassador was tricked into throwing in with the traitor's lot, yeah?」
 His prickly tone of voice was making me feel uneasy.
 If I just let Wakaba keep talking about her play―
 st03_a00
 v03wa0961
 ワカバ「There's no problem with that. Ein isn't a bad person, after all!」
 v44xx0005
 酔親父「...Huh, what did ya just say? Repeat that for me, one more time.」
 
 v04ce0880
 セロ「...Wakaba, you should stop.」
 st03_a02
 v03wa0962
 ワカバ「No way, I'm just getting to the interesting part!」
 Can't she read the atmosphere!?
 st03_a01
 v03wa0963
 ワカバ「In the story I wrote, Ein remains loyal until the very end. I'm making that the selling point of the play we're performing at our local theater festival.」
 
 v44xx0006
 酔親父「...Heh, really. A twist like that deserves a present!」
 
 
 The drunken old man laughed scornfully and, with a sneer on his face and his eyes focused on Wakaba, took something from the table.
 
 I realized what was going to happen, and immediately pushed Wakaba aside...
 
 v44xx0007
 酔親父「Catch this!」
 Something like a red ball came flying at me, and then―
 
 
 white450
 ―Splat!
 After the impact, I felt a heavy weight in the place I'd been hit.
 st03_a09
 Something cold was flowing down my forehead, and now everyone in the bar was staring at me, unmoving. It was as if time had frozen.
 The person who'd thrown that probably hadn't expected it to hit either, as now his mouth was silently flapping open and closed.

 v03wa0965
 ワカバ「I'm fine but, ah, the tomato on your head is...」
 v04ce0882
 セロ「So it's a tomato, ahaha.」
 It's a relief that it wasn't something hard.
 As long as Wakaba isn't hurt, that's enough.
 v44xx0008
 酔親父「Well, you didn't have to move, you went and brought it on yourself...」
 ......
 Judging by Wakaba's and my height, if we had stayed still it might not have hit us.
 
 v44xx0009
 酔親父「A, anyway! It's your fault for saying Ein is a good guy. Right, everyone?」
 
 
 The drunken old man raised up the cup he was holding as he tried to find someone else in the bar to agree with him.
 
 ―But, what happened next was...

 トニ―「Ein isn't the one in wrong, you nameless old man, you are.」
 Said a young man in black suit, gripping a rolled-up newspaper.
 v44xx0010
 酔親父「Wha, what did you say!? I dare ya to say that again!」
 
 v07to0002
 トニ―「I can say it as many times as you want. However I look at it, you're the one in the wrong here.」

 酔親父「U, ugh, you bastard...」
 v07to0004
 トニ―「Oh, are you going to throw another tomato? Who's the owner of this place, I wonder? Barkeep―, is this man secretly the owner?」
 
 
 The man behind the counter silently shook his head in response to the young man's question.
 
 v07to0005
 トニ―「Then, since you're just another customer, the most you can do is say ‘You're noisy,’ that's how I see it... What do you all think?」
 
 This time, the other customers all followed suit and nodded wordlessly.
 After seeing this scene, the drunken old man clicked his tongue and started to head outside.
 
 ev011c
 v07to0006
 トニ―「Wait just a minute! Are you thinking of just leaving like that without paying the bill?」
 
 
 v44xx0012
 酔親父「What did you say!?」
 The old man growled while heading towards the younger man, and raised his fist meaningfully.
 
 v07to0007
 トニ―「―Regardless of the reason, this innocent young boy was hit with your tomato.」
 v07to0008
 トニ―「Shouldn't you at least provide the money to clean his clothes?」
 v44xx0013
 酔親父「Mmmgggrrrr... Is, is this enough!?」
 Through the gaps of the hand that slammed down on the table, there were several bills visible.
 The young man smiled as he saw that.
 v07to0009
 トニ―「Well, now all that's left is the barkeep's compensation, and then you can leave.」
 v44xx0014
 酔親父「Y, you bastard...」
  The old man reached out to grab the young man's collar.
 But the young man swiftly dodged it and whispered a couple words in the old man's ear.
 v07to0010
 トニ―「Leave the rest to me.」
  After saying that―
 v44xx0015
 酔親父「...I, I got it.」
 Even though the old man looked somewhat dissatisfied, he left the shop just like that.
 I wonder what that young man said to him―
 ev011b
 v07to0011
 トニ―「Ah-ah, what a way to mess up a nice lad. Are you hurt?」
 v04ce0883

 トニ―「How about the lass over there, are you unharmed?」
 v03wa0966
 ワカバ「I, I'm fine.」
 v07to0013
 トニ―「Then we're good! Barkeep, could you bring me a towel?」
 
 v04ce0884
 セロ「Er... Thank you very much for helping us out of that dangerous situation earlier.」
 
 I don't know what I'm supposed to say at times like these, so I just apologized.

 v07to0014
 トニ―「Ah, it's okay. Stuff like this happens all the time.」

 v07to0017

 v07to0018
 トニ―「This area was the land of the Blue Kingdom during the time that story took place.」
 v07to0019
 トニ―「That the Blue Ambassador who was sent to the White Kingdom had become the betrayer's ally... If the locals heard something like that, nothing good would come from it, right?」
 
 
 v03wa0968
 ワカバ「B, but but, that's already in the past! Plus, it's just a story I made, why would they get angry over that?」
 
 
 v07to0020
 トニ―「...That old man's ancestor was actually the Blue Ambassador.」
 v04ce0886

 v03wa0969
 ワカバ「How could that be!」

 ワカバ「Something about that felt a bit wrong―」
  She said that before I could say anything.

 ワカバ「To put it in more detail. ...That person just ran off after pocketing the cleaning fee that drunken man left earlier.」
 
 ...Now that she's mentioned it, that had indeed happened.
 But, to go chasing after him just to ask ‘How about that money...’ would be an awkward thing to do.

 Even though she's a Schwester, she's no different from a human.
 
 
 Not just her expression, but her body language made it clear she still wasn't in good shape.

 Watching Belle trying to force herself to get up, I―
 v00an0542
 アンジ「How many times must I tell you, Schwester.」
  said that without thinking.
 v00an0543
 アンジ「I'm sorry. I accidentally said something from the audition.」
 Realizing that I'd been impolite, I quickly tried to explain myself.
 There wasn't actually a line like that in the script, it's just that I'd fallen into my Princess Christina role.
 Hopefully she hadn't misunderstood me because of those harsh words...

 Neither of us knew what to do in this awkward atmosphere.
 Belle's already in poor shape, I shouldn't stress her out even more.

 I might be contradicting what I said earlier, but this was the right thing to do. I'm sure of it!

 ベル「Then, I'm sorry... could you help me open the window?」
 After hearing that reply, I felt my effort had been wasted.
 ...Doesn't ‘getting some fresh air’ normally mean ‘going for a walk’?
 Maybe I need to say it straight out for her to understand?
 v00an0546
 アンジ「...That's not what I meant. What I was trying to say was, it's okay for you to take a short walk around outside.」
 
 Her eyes widened. Fearing that she still didn't get it... I reached out to touch her slender arm.
 v00an0547
 アンジ「I'll go with you, how about that?」
 Her temperature was normal. It wasn't hot the way a child's is when they have a fever.
 But even if I judge her temperature, it's meaningless as I'm not a doctor...
  She didn't gave me an answer, so I didn't remove my hand.
 v01be0455
 ベル「...Is it really okay?」
 After a brief pause, she replied. Hearing the note of anticipation in her voice, I felt a little relieved.
 I kept that thought to myself, without letting it show on my face, and brought Belle's shoes over to the bedside.
 v00an0548

 As Light said, Belle was still asleep when everyone came to visit her, so they had been one-sided meetings.

 Watching Light as he worried over whether Coco could understand something like that, I thought back on what I'd said earlier.
 Now that I thought about it calmly, it's not like there would be any problem with Light tagging along with us.
 If he'd gotten excited and went too far, I could have just put a stop to it then.
 Or had I stopped him from coming along because I'd subconsciously feared that it would inevitably happen?

 トニ―「This is Cero! He's our customer this time.」
 
 face07_a01
 v07to0041
 トニ―「...And this is the doll engineer I mentioned earlier― Silvia.」
 Tonino, acting as the intermediary, quickly introduced us to each other.
 v04ce0903
 セロ「He, hello. I'm Cero.」
 Not wanting to be rude, I introduced myself once more.
 st06_a05
 v06si0002
 シルヴ「Ah, ahh! I see, I see! I've heard so much about you...」
 
 
 v04ce0904
 セロ「(―So much about me?)」
 Have I met Silvia somewhere before?
 No, that couldn't be it, since I only just met her now through Tonino―
 face07_a08
 v07to0042
 トニ―「You've got it wrong! That ‘Cero’ was a different person, this is a new Cero.」
 
 st06_a04
 v06si0003
 シルヴ「Ah, how rude of me. So, his name is Cero too?」
 face07_a00
 Finally understanding what the other had meant to say, the two simultaneously broke out laughing.
 It seemed they've had another customer by the same name.
 st06_a04
 v06si0004
 シルヴ「So, what brings you here today?」
 v04ce0905
 セロ「Actually, I have a Sister with me―」
 
 
 I pulled myself together, and explained once more what I'd said to Tonino earlier.
 
 st06_a00
 v06si0005
 シルヴ「...Oh, I see, I see. So the Sister isn't in a good shape.」
 
 
 face07_a01
 v07to0043
 トニ―「That's right! That's why I thought of bringing him here and letting you, a professional, fix that Sister instantly and effortlessly.」
 
 
 st06_a02
 v06si0006
 シルヴ「...Idiot. Doll engineering isn't as simple as you think. You're always like this, making a trifle of my skills―」
 
 
 face07_a04
 v07to0044
 トニ―「Oh, sorry. I just wanted to show off in front of Cero.」
 st06_a07
 v06si0007
 シルヴ「Hmph, whatever.」
 Seems like Silvia is the more important partner of the two.
 face07_a00
 st06_a00
 v06si0008
 シルヴ「...So, when was that Sister created?」
 
 
 v04ce0906
 セロ「I don't really know the details, but she was probably created long, long ago.」
 
 
 st06_a03
 v06si0009
 シルヴ「...Hmm. If that's the case, it could be a bit difficult.」
 Performing maintenance on ancient Sisters is a headache for younger doll engineers, I guess?
 
 
 st06_a07
 v06si0010
 シルヴ「But, it should work out somehow. Ah, but, hmm...」
 She looked up at the ceiling, then down to the floor.
  She seemed restless, and it looked like she wanted to say something.
 v04ce0907
 セロ「Is something the matter?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0011
 シルヴ「...Hmm. Even though I won't know before I examine her, the Drops I have with me...」
 
 
 Silvia shot a glance at her partner.
 Tonino nodded in reply, and said,
 face07_a01
 v07to0045
 トニ―「Just tell him straight out that he'll have to pay for them later.」
 
 st06_a02
 v06si0012
 シルヴ「...‘Just tell him straight out,’ you say?」
 face07_a04
 v07to0046
 トニ―「...Honesty is the best policy, that's what I think.」
 After rolling her eyes at his waggish attitude, she took a deep breath and stared at me.
 st06_a06
 v06si0013
 シルヴ「Honestly, things like Drops aren't cheap.」
 
 
 v04ce0908
 セロ「Err...」
 I knew a little about that.
 But since I've never actually bought any before, I have no idea how much they really cost.
 
 st06_a00
 v06si0014
 シルヴ「They aren't extravagantly expensive, but I'll need to use a few to perform a medical examination.」
 face07_a00
 v07to0047
 トニ―「After using one, you can't use it on any other Sisters, right, Master Silvia?」
 
 
 
 st06_a04
 v06si0015
 シルヴ「That's how it is.」
 After responding to him, Silvia closed her eyes.
 In any case, what she was trying to say was ‘Everything costs money, can you afford it?’
 v04ce0909
 セロ「I understand. ...So, how much would it cost?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0016
 シルヴ「...It depends on her situation, but it's about this much.」
 On the piece of paper she handed to me, there was a list: Memory Stone, Movement Stone, Five Senses Stone, and some others.
 A column of numbers were aligned beside the words; seems like this is what she meant by ‘not cheap.’
 v04ce0910
 セロ「(―I mustn't make any mistakes with the math...)」
 To be sure, I counted with my fingers under the table― and realized that the total amount was somewhere in between all of my money and half of it.
 v04ce0911
 セロ「I, I can still afford this amount... But you said the actual figure depends on her situation, so...」
 st06_a00
 v06si0017
 シルヴ「Well, I'll give you a discount if the full price is beyond your means. Besides, it's hard to find a customer for these.」
 Silvia closed her eyes and murmured ‘Just like it's hard to find us engineers,’ before rising from her chair.
 st06_a01
 v06si0018
 シルヴ「Anyway, let's go take a look at that Sister.」
 
 
 v04ce0912
 セロ「T, thank you so much!」
 Now, as long as her condition doesn't get worse before Rein comes―
 st06_a00
 v06si0019
 シルヴ「...But, before that. Give me a minute.」
 face07_a05
 v07to0048
 トニ―「Oh, where are you going, Master?」
 st06_a02
 v06si0020
 シルヴ「...To do my makeup.」
 After pinching Tonino's smiling cheek, she left.
 
 While we who were left waiting smiled sheepishly at each other in an attempt to break the awkward atmosphere.

 トニ―「...Ah―, Cero. Actually, I have something to tell you.」
 v04ce0913
 セロ「What is it?」
 After confirming that Silvia was definitely gone, Tonino called to me and, waving his hand, invited me over to the table in the middle.
 
 st07_a03
 v07to0050
 トニ―「It's about Master Silvia―」
 st07_a09
 v07to0051
 トニ―「There's a possibility that she might not accept your money after the medical examination.」
 v04ce0914
 セロ「Eh? Why?」
 
 Wasn't she just worrying about whether I could afford it or not?
 st07_a04
 v07to0052
 トニ―「Well, how should I say it, she's too softhearted. But, if that happens, then I won't get my mediator's fee either...」
 According to Tonino's rough explanation, she's honest about the price before taking on the job, but when it came time to pay up, she'll be magnanimous and say ‘It's okay.’
 It'll be troublesome for us, the ones she's working for, if she doesn't accept the money.
 v04ce0915
 セロ「I'll definitely pay. Even if she doesn't want it, I'll forcibly give it to her. If not, then...」
 I took out my wallet and checked the amount of cash in it, then deducted the minimum amount needed for the hotel fee and other expenses.
 ...If I were better at math, I could have handed it over to him straight away.
 I wasn't, so I had to calm down and calculate carefully. As a result, I found out that it'd be fine even if I gave them half of the money I had with me.
 
 v04ce0916
 セロ「...Then, please take this as an advance.」
 st07_a05
 v07to0053
 トニ―「Advance? Tha, that's inconvenient for you...」
 
 v04ce0917
 セロ「It's fine, since this is just part of the money I'll have to pay anyway...」
 If it's still not enough, I'll have to borrow some money to pay them before Rein arrives.
 
 st07_a01
 v07to0054
 トニ―「Well, since you put it that way, I'll take it. Thanks.」
 face06_a05
 v06si0021
 シルヴ「Hey, thanks for waiting... What are you two up to?」
 st07_a08
 v07to0055
 トニ―「Nah, it's nothing. Right, Cero?」
 v04ce0918
 セロ「Ye, yeah!」
 I thought she'd overheard our conversation, but luckily it seems she hadn't noticed anything.
 But she seemed to have something else on her mind, and turned to look at us.
 
 face06_a06
 v06si0022
 シルヴ「...Hm? Oh well. So, where is that Sister?」
 
  
 
 I told Silvia that I was heading back to the room to get Belle's approval first, then left the pub in a hurry.

 I'm sure Tonino will think of something to ensure she collects her fee in the end.

 st07_a04
 v07to0056
 トニ―「Well, there are meetings that seem fated in life.」
 v06si0024
 シルヴ「Stop fooling around and give me a serious answer.」
 I pinched Tonino's nose, and continued.
 v06si0025
 シルヴ「It's hard for me to do this without information. If he knew more about Sisters, our cover would have been blown, you know?」
 
 
 st07_a12

 v06si0026
 シルヴ「All right, and then?」
 st07_a00
 v07to0058
 トニ―「...I met him here last night. Some old man was bothering him, so I helped him out. That's how I met him.」
 
 v06si0027
 シルヴ「Heh, so even you can be helpful sometimes.」
 st07_a04
 v07to0059
 トニ―「Obviously! Who helped you cover up your mistake earlier?」
 
 v06si0028
 シルヴ「Hmph! You, of course.」
 
 During Cero's introduction, I had accidentally let ‘I've heard so much about you...’ slip out.
 st07_a01
 v07to0060
 トニ―「That's why you should pay more attention to ever-dependable me,」
 he said, showing off how he'd covered for me.
 v06si0029
 シルヴ「...Fine, fine.」
 As a partner, Tonino was definitely not bad.
 He usually acts as my driver, but he'd brought me a customer this time.
 He was too much of a lightweight to be my drinking partner, but he'd overlook it when I got too smashed.
 
 v06si0030
 シルヴ「(―Still...)」
 The problem was that in front of Tonino, who had a good relationship with me―
 st07_a03
 v07to0061
 トニ―「Hey, Silvia.」
 v06si0031
 シルヴ「What?」
  Don't interfere when other people are thinking!
 st07_a02
 v07to0062
 トニ―「...What are you planning to do after this job?」
 What Tonino meant by ‘this job’ was probably Cero's business.
 v06si0032
 シルヴ「What do you mean?」
 st07_a06
 v07to0063
 トニ―「I'm asking if you're going to... leave this town.」
 v06si0033
 シルヴ「...What do you mean by that?」
 st07_a04
 v07to0064
 トニ―「Earlier, I saw a bulletin in front of City Hall. It seems that we're wanted in this town already.」
 v06si0034
 シルヴ「...Could you have mistaken... no, I guess not.」
 This is bad, very bad.
 st07_a07
 v07to0065
 トニ―「Seems like the deal before with that perverted old man lead us down a dead end.」
 
 
 v06si0035
 シルヴ「Don't make me remember that dis-gus-ting person!」
 Back then, I'd heard that there was someone who was willing to purchase Drops in bulk, so I'd dropped by his house.
 
 
 But waiting for me was a lewd old man.
 If he'd just touched my hands or shoulders, I could endure it, but―
 v06si0036
 シルヴ「...Ahh, damn! My butt itches at the thought of that!」
 
 st07_a04
 v07to0066
 トニ―「...Silvia, don't tell me... are you unsatisfied? If so, we could go upstairs...」
 
 v06si0037
 シルヴ「Idiot! What crap are you blabbering about in broad daylight! Geez!」
 
 
 white450
 If it's Tonino, I can just slap him and forget about it, but I couldn't forgive that old man so easily.
 After slapping him on the cheek, I'd pushed him over and kicked his ass, but, to make it worse, he'd made weird noises like ‘Ahn~!’ for me to hear!
 
 Disgusted, I'd left him like that and went back, but the next morning...
 We'd been labeled a ‘Drop stealing team,’ and thus unwillingly made our criminal debut.
 v06si0038
 シルヴ「I haven't even broken any laws yet...」
 st07_a09
 v07to0067
 トニ―「...That ‘yet’ seems quite suspicious.」

 トニ―「Oi, oi, you're too loud! Anyway, after this job's over, let's get out of Aubergine right away.」
 
 v06si0040
 シルヴ「Yeah, in order to do that...」
 I'll have to get a lot of cash out of our current customer― Cero.
 Of course, I'll properly fix any problem that falls between the beginner and middle levels in doll engineering.
 ...With the cheapest Drops that will do the job, that is.
 
 
 Since both sides of our deal are in trouble, this should make us even.
 st07_a00

 トニ―「Oops, speak of the devil. Oi―, Cero, how did it go?」
 Cero entered the bar, and trotted back over to our table.
 face04_a05
 v04ce0919
 セロ「Ah, hello. About that, I thought she would be in the room, but...」
 The door was locked, and there seemed to be no one inside, so she might have gone out... said Cero.

 トニ―「Do you know where she might have gone? Or maybe someone called her out of the room, or something?」
 
 face04_a06

 セロ「She might have left with the girl who was taking care of her.」
 
 v06si0041
 シルヴ「...Hmm, how troubling.」
 
 There's nothing I can do if the Sister isn't here.
 Well, I could have just handed Cero a couple of Drops and told him ‘This should be enough, I'll leave the rest to you!’, but my conscience wouldn't allow it.
 
 
 
 ...But they've already put out wanted posters for us, so I don't want to stay in this town for long.
 
 v06si0042
 シルヴ「(―We have to at least get a car ready so we can leave anytime...)」

 v07to0071

 v06si0045

 st07_a07
 v07to0072

 v06si0046

 v07to0073
 トニ―「Oh, I see. Roger―!」
 st07_a01
 Tonino headed up the hotel's stairs while humming to himself, and after watching him go, I got out of the car.
 
 She's a sick person, after all. Where could she have gone?
 Sick people should just stay in their rooms and rest.
 She must be a child-type Sister, wandering around while wobbling and swaying.

 A Sister that was hard to describe in words had raised her head to look at me.

 v06si0049

 You don't usually find Sisters in remote area like this.
 
 
 So this child must be the Sister Cero was asking me to check up on!

 v06si0052

 This girl ought to be my patient, as long as there aren't any more Ceros that have Sisters around.

 v02co1497
 ココ「Are you, Ce-ro's, friend―?」
 v06si0053
 シルヴ「...Well, something like that.」
 It wasn't necessary to explain everything to her.
  If something went wrong, it would be a hassle to fix.
 v06si0054
 シルヴ「Your throat's not well, huh?」
 st02_a04
 v02co1498
 ココ「Is―, that, so―?」
 v06si0055
 シルヴ「Well, it seems that way to me... More like, I can't even understand what you're saying.」
 Judging from her appearance, this Sister was quite old indeed.
 
 
 I had pretended that older sisters were hard to work with in front of Cero, but in truth I had just wanted to raise the price.
 
 In fact, for me, it was fortunate that she was an older type Sister.
 v06si0056
 シルヴ「Since the Drops I have on me are―」
 
 
 Worn-out antiques themselves, they have hardly any effect on newer Sisters.
 
 
 Being able to use them at a time like this must be divine providence.
 v06si0057
 シルヴ「All right! I'm going to fix this real quick! Chop chop!」
 
 st02_b06
 v02co1499
 ココ「Chop, Cha! Cha, Chachacha!」
 
 I don't get what she's so happy about... maybe she's just imitating me. Seems like her condition really isn't that good after all.
 v06si0058
 シルヴ「Okay, where are your Drops...」
 
 
 I squatted down and found them immediately.
 st02_d02
 v06si0059
 シルヴ「(―To just put them in a bottle and hang it around her neck...)」
 This wasn't just the fastest I've ever found a Sister's Drops, but it's also the biggest culture shock I've ever received.
 Even though I've often seen Sisters who had their Drops outside their body, to put them in a transparent bottle like that is―
 
 
 
 v06si0060
 シルヴ「T, this is a pretty violent design. I don't hate it, though.」
 st02_a08
 v02co1500
 ココ「No, violence―」
 v06si0061
 シルヴ「Yup, that's right. So, Coco, could you lend me that bottle around your neck for a while?」
 
 st02_a03
 v02co1501
 ココ「Eh―? Why―?」
 
 v06si0062
 シルヴ「I'm going to fix it for you. Come on, give it to me.」
 st02_a02
 v02co1502
 ココ「...Oh, here.」
 Coco obediently bowed down and let me take the bottle from her.
 v06si0063
 シルヴ「Hmm, hmm. These stones are arranged in a wishy-washy way. ...They've just been thrown together.」
 
 But considering how she can still move normally, it seems like this Sister was created with a pretty impressive technique.
 
 v06si0064
 シルヴ「...Speech Stone, Speech Stone... Huh? Something's wrong.」
 
 At first glance, I saw no Speech Stone inside the bottle.
 If that's the case, maybe she's speaking with the help of a supporting stone stored inside her body?
 v06si0065
 シルヴ「...Oh well. Let's try putting it in.」
 I only had one Speech Stone left.
 Luckily, this stone was the most expensive one on that list, looks like this sale was a big success!
 I didn't have to use any method that would weigh on my conscience to make the sale, and could openly accept payment.
 
 v06si0066
 シルヴ「Here, it's done. So how do you feel?」
 st02_a03
 v02co1503
 ココ「Hm―? Feels a bit, wha, wa―?」
 
 v06si0067
 シルヴ「How strange. Maybe it needs some time to take effect?」
 
 But even if the effect is minimal, there should still be some sign of improvement...
 v06si0068
 シルヴ「How about doing some speaking practice? ...Say something like ‘Yah’ or ‘Yup.’」
 
 st02_b05
 v02co1504

 シルヴ「There doesn't seem to be any difference from earlier... Wait, isn't that just your normal reply?」
 st02_a02
 v02co1505

 If that's the case, I'm going to have to wait for Cero to come back and have him judge how much of an improvement it is. There's no other way to confirm the change.

 It's not Coco, but Belle?
 Because of my mistake, I've given a Drop to Coco for no reason.
 
 
 v06si0078

 At that moment, I was waiting for Belle to come back.

 With that thought, I went back and waited in my room, which was across from theirs.

 セロ「Hmm, it'd be unexpected, but it's possible that they're still in the hotel.」
 Since this hotel has several floors, it's possible we just missed each other due to bad timing.

 I figured it was Belle, but a second later I recognized those distinctive footsteps.
 Those were unmistakeably Coco's footsteps.

 She loudly sprinted along the hallway, slamming into the other patrons as she did.

 She even shocked the hotel workers into dropping the dishes they carried.
 After making various other attempts to stop her, I tried to jump on top of Coco as she ran back past the room, but I failed once again.

 Coco dashed around the floor, then headed downstairs at the same speed.

 But, there were a bunch of side streets. I wasn't sure if I should go straight or take a turn.

 While standing still and straining my eyes, I spotted Coco across the road and quickly started after her.

 st01_a00
 v01be0463
 ベル「...Yes. I'm much better now.」
 After Cero had phoned me the day before yesterday to tell me of my daughter Belle's situation, I had been nervous for awhile.
 
 
 
 ...Luckily, her condition hadn't worsened since then.
 She'd recovered enough to go out for a walk the day before, so it seems like it wasn't necessary for me to worry.
 v11re0198
 レイン「How unlike you to fall sick... even though it was my fault.」
 I had given her those Drops when she'd left for the Blue Capital for medical reasons- namely, to help her if being in an unfamilar place was making her anxious.
 
 
 Originally, I had intended to give her just one, but it seems like I'd been acting senile... and gave her too many, causing her to fall ill.
 st01_a03
 v01be0464
 ベル「No, it's not your fault. I'm the one who made a mistake.」
 My daughter shook her head as she tried to comfort me.
 Since we've been father and daughter for over half a century, we each knew each other's personality well.
 Recently, she's grown to accomodate me.
 black450
 v11re0199
 レイン「Anyway, let's examine you first.」
 ev014a
 v11re0200

 I decided to perform Belle's maintenance as I investigated the problem.
 To humans, this would be like as conducting an interview while doing an operation.
 It was a method of treatment found only in doll engineering.
 ev014c
 v11re0201
 レイン「You haven't spit your Drops out yet, right?」
 
 
 v01be0465
 ベル「No, I haven't.」
 Some engineers don't like performing these tasks simultaneously, as they worry it will decrease their accuracy, but this way was easier for me.
 v11re0202
 レイン「Then, I'll take them out.」
 As I had thought, the main reason she wasn't feeling well was because the energy the Drops emitted surpassed the limits of what her body could handle.
 
 
 ...But, somehow I felt that that wasn't the only problem.
 ev014d
 v11re0203
 レイン「...Are you concerned about something?」
 v01be0466

 v11re0204

 My daughter's ambivalence was revealed by the behavior of her stones.
 v11re0205
 レイン「Do you have something on your mind?」
 ev014e
 v01be0467
 ベル「...Yes.」
 She had paused before answering me.
 That meant that her answer came from a place close to her subconscious.
 
 
 v11re0206
 レイン「It's about the theater festival, right? Do you still have any misgivings about participating with them?」
 v01be0468

 v11re0207
 レイン「Hmm. Rather than misgivings, it's unease, right?」
 v01be0469
 ベル「...Yes.」
 ev014c
 v11re0208
 レイン「As for why you're uneasy... I don't think it's necessary to ask that question.」
 The main reason Wakaba had invited my daughter was because she was a Sister.
 
 
 But, she had asked more of Belle than that.
 v11re0209
 レイン「(―Singing, eh...)」
 I stopped questioning her, and began thinking... wondering what the best solution would be.
 
 I could temporarily reinforce her willpower via tuning.
 Or I could do nothing but believe in her, and trust that she can overcome this by herself and sing.
 What should I do, as a father?
 ev014d
 v11re0210
 レイン「...What a quandary.」
 Even at this age, I still can't act without hesitation.
 But the compass needle within my heart always points in one direction.
 v11re0211
 レイン「(―Failure is a stepping stone to success...)」
 No matter what happens, gaining experience is the most important thing of all.
 And all living creatures mature through the path they have chosen by themselves.
 That's why I shouldn't interfere, and leave the choice for her to make.
 ev014a
 v11re0212
 レイン「...Do you want to sing in front of others?」
 v01be0470
 ベル「...Yes.」
 v11re0213
 レイン「If that's the case, I'll give you another Drop later.」
 
 
 I tried to reuse the Drop that couldn't be used to maintain her body.
 This time, I imbued it with a different effect: to help her stand before others without becoming nervous, and to allow her to concentrate and focus her strength.
 v11re0214
 レイン「...I'll leave it for you to decide if you want to use it or not.」
 
 Her life is hers alone.
 
 
 
 
 No matter how she came into existence, as long as she has life, she has the right to live according to her own will.

 Cero or Wakaba weren't sitting with us, either. It was only the two of us.
 
 Normally, I would have been on edge since he's a man, but because he's old, it wasn't that bad.

 What Rein was trying to tell me, was probably something he's learned from the wisdom of a full life... I guess?

 According to what Wakaba told me earlier, they had a tomato thrown at them when they were talking about the play's contents.

 v01be0500

 But, I understood one thing.
 The fact is that, while I was still reading off the draft, Angelina had already memorized the lines and was able to recite them by heart.
 
 Is that ability expected of people who want to become actors?
 
 st00_a07
 v00an0650
 アンジ「...Even so, what a dramatic opening scene. It's as if the Schwester was defiant... or rather, cold.」
 
 
 st00_a04
 v00an0651
 アンジ「―And in turn, Princess Christina never asked her name and merely continued calling her ‘Schwester’ in the end.」
 
 After reading the continuation of the earlier part, it was just as Angelina said.
 But though Princess Christina had pushed this view onto her, the Schwester accepted it without any hesitation.
 
 
 
 Keeping her name to herself... What did this Schwester hope would come of that?
 
 
 st00_a06
 v00an0652
 アンジ「Since the Schwester's name wasn't recorded in the first place, this kind of explanation appeared. I wonder if they just made it up?」

 st00_a04

 ...If Angelina kept calling me Schwester...
  I wonder what that would feel like?
 v01be0502

 st00_a05

 st00_a00
 v00an0656
 アンジ「How commendable. Since you asked, I'd be happy to. I might even be able to grasp Princess Christina's feelings this way.」
 
 
 Angelina nodded her head, put on a serious expression,
 st00_a06
 v00an0657
 アンジ「―As I know Schwesters are Schwesters... For me, that is enough,」
 
 
 
  and repeated that line.
 
 
 After that, though, she didn't ask me to do the same with her.
 Thus, when I mentioned we should both exchange our names for our stage titles―
 st00_a11
 v00an0658
 アンジ「Ah, but you know... Calling me Princess Christina would definitely be a bit over the top!」

 st00_a10
 v00an0659
 アンジ「B, but... it'd be weird if you started calling me ‘Princess, Princess’ in the middle of the street, right?」
 
 
 Now that she mentions it, I can see the problem.
 We can only refer to each other by our stage name when we're alone.
 Even though I feel a bit lonely this way, I'll just have to endure it until it's time for practice.

 That means- Angelina is Angelina.
 Only on stage will she be Princess Christina.

 I don't know what he needed it for, but not having soap seemed to have put him in a tough spot.
 I decided to return to my room to see if Coco had come back, and get the soap for Light while I was there.

 My vision went blank.
 This isn't right!
 Why is it Wakaba!?
 And not Light!?
 After knocking, I had found that the door wasn't locked, and as I'd gone in, planning to say ‘You're pretty careless’ to Light―
 I heard the sound of the shower running coming out from the bathroom.
 In my mind, the soap and the shower are connected.
 Therefore, I had naturally thought ‘So Light wanted to take a shower.’
 But, in reality―

 v01be0512_2
 ベル「You're right. I wonder how many people were living here back then...」
 v00an0668
 アンジ「Some say that there actually weren't that many people living in the Castle.」
 After Wakaba and the others left, Belle and I took a slow stroll along the Castle wall.
 
 v00an0669
 アンジ「It's a shame that we can't go inside and look around.」
 st01_a04
 Though I wasn't as upset as Wakaba, I was still irritated.
 It wasn't like we could reproduce all the Castle's rooms and hallways on stage, but I still would've liked to see the real thing for once.
 
 v00an0670
 アンジ「Hey, Schwester.」
 st01_a06
 v01be0514

 It seems that had been an after-effect of our practice earlier. I couldn't help but laugh.

 v00an0672
 アンジ「If it's bothering you, then tell me. I won't keep calling you that if that's so.」
 
 Even though I was the one to say that, those words suddenly made me feel uncomfortable.
 v00an0673
 アンジ「(―Have I never... called her ‘Belle?’)」
 That couldn't be... But as I searched through my memories, I realized I've never called her by name before.
 No, I did when we first met, but is that the only time?
 It's obvious that I was already used to calling her ‘you’ and ‘Schwester’.
 
 st01_a05
 v01be0516

 We chatted about pointless things, and soon had made a full circle of the castle. By then it was about time for lunch, so we headed back to town.
 
 bg14a01
 As we were discussing where to go eat, we spotted a raised platform in the middle of the city square.
 People were starting to gather around it.
 
 v00an0678
 アンジ「What in the world is going on?」
 Judging by the chatter I overheard coming from the crowd, it seems the junior choir team is having an open rehearsal for recruitment purposes.
 Since fewer children are participating each year, they had choosen a busy spot like this in the hopes of catching peoples' attention and finding new members.
 
 st01_a00
 v01be0520
 ベル「I wonder what's going to happen?」
 v00an0679
 アンジ「Seems those children from the choir are going to sing.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0521
 ベル「...Wow.」
 Belle seemed interested, so we waited in the square. After a while, a group of children all dressed in white gathered.
 
 An idea popped into my head.
 v00an0680
 アンジ「Do you want to try singing too?」
  Just after that came out of my mouth...
 st01_a04
 v01be0522
 ベル「...For the sake of practice?」
 Unexpectedly, she seemed eager as well.
 This is the perfect opportunity... I walked over to the person who looked like he was the manager, and spoke to him.
 
 v00an0681
 アンジ「Hello, excuse me. Can I ask for a little favor―」
 After he heard what I had to say, he agreed straightaway.
 There weren't any spare uniforms for the choir team, but participating in my current clothes would be...
 v00an0682
 アンジ「Ah, that's okay, since I'm not the one who will be singing.」
 If I joined the group, it would spoil the effect of their uniforms.
 Belle is wearing a cute plain white blouse, so her appearance won't be a problem.
 v00an0683
 アンジ「...So, that's how it is. I already told them you'd be singing.」
 st01_a08
 v01be0523
 ベル「...Huh, were you serious!?」
 Belle said in a shocked voice.
 st01_a07
 v01be0524
 ベル「...No way, what should I do...」
 With things as they are, she has no choice but to just do it.
 v00an0684
 アンジ「In any case, now that it's come to this, you'll just have to do it, right?」
 Even though I'm being pushy, it's not only for her sake... it's also for the sake of making the play a reality.
 I patted her back and encouraged her, so that she wouldn't be afraid.
 v00an0685
 アンジ「Calm down. Here are the score and lyrics. ...It's a classical song though, are you okay with that?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0525
 ベル「...Yes. I know this song by heart.」
 
 
 v00an0686
 アンジ「Then it'll be easy for you!」
 st01_a08
 v01be0526
 ベル「B, but, that's if nobody else is listening.」
 v00an0687
 アンジ「I know, that's why this is perfect for you.」
 If it turned out that Belle couldn't sing, she'd be covered by the other children's singing.
 v00an0688
 アンジ「If you can't do it no matter what, then it's fine even if you just match their lip movements.」
 st01_a03
 v01be0527
 ベル「H, how could I? That would be troublesome for the choir members, and it'd be like deceiving the audience...」
 
 v00an0689
 アンジ「Then you'll just have to give it your all and sing. ...Right?」
 She has to overcome this sooner or later, so it'd be better if it was sooner.
 Furthermore, it'll be a waste if we don't seize an opportunity like this.
 st01_a06
 v01be0528
 ベル「Do you think... I can do it?」
 v00an0690
 アンジ「It's because you're you that I know you can do it.」
 This conversation was similar to the one we had on that night.
 I moved to face Belle, placed my hands on her shoulders, and looked her right in the eyes.
 And then, feeling playful,
 v00an0691
 アンジ「Do you want me to cheer for you? Or...」
 
 
 st01_a05
 v00an0692
 アンジ「―Shall I be the one that watches over you?」
  I said.
 st01_a11
 v01be0529
 ベル「...Both are fine.」
 Her answer was a little surprising, and it left me momentarily at a loss.
 st01_a10
 v01be0530
 ベル「If you're here with me, Miss Angelina, then I really feel like I'll be able to sing.」
 st01_a03
 v01be0531
 ベル「―But, I also want to become stronger on stage, so I can be of use to Her Highness.」
 v00an0693
 アンジ「...It's okay. I'm sure Princess Christina will watch over you, too.」
 I tousled Belle's hair, and slowly nodded to her.
 Then, she nodded to herself, as if she had made her decision, and looked in the direction of the choir.
 st01_a01
 v01be0532
 ベル「I'm ready.」
 v00an0694
 アンジ「Yup!」
 Anything else I said would only be a burden, so I stepped back without another word.
 
 v01be0533
 st01_a04
 She seemed to murmur something to herself, then went over to greet the choir team and their manager.
 
 v00an0695
 アンジ「(―Seems like they're welcoming her.)」
 I couldn't hear their conversation from where I was, but the atmosphere there seemed friendly.
 I could read that much just from the look on Belle's face when she returned.
 st01_a00
 v01be0534
 ベル「...They're going to start soon, so I'll go get into the line.」
 v00an0696
 アンジ「Do your best. I'll carry the basket for you.」
 I reached out and pointed at her luggage.
 st01_a04
 ...But Belle looked troubled.
 st01_a00
 v01be0535
 ベル「Please, give me a moment.」
 She turned her back on me, and opened the lid of the basket as if she was trying to hide something.
 
 v00an0697
 アンジ「(―I guess she doesn't want anyone to see it...)」
 v01be0536
 =ベル「What is it, Your High... I mean, Angelina-san.」
 After a while, it seemed like Belle had finished arranging the contents of the basket, and she slowly handed it to me.
 st01_a00
 v01be0537
 ベル「...I'll leave it to you.」
 v00an0698
 アンジ「I'll definitely take care of it.」
  Honestly, I was curious about what's inside.
 ...But, compared to that, I was much more curious about what Belle had in her hands.
 v00an0699
 アンジ「(―T, that's...)」
 For an instant, I saw it - a Drop?
 
 
 Even though I haven't seen a real one before, my intuition guessed that from the brightness of it shining through the gaps between her fingers.
 
 st01_a01
 v01be0538
 ベル「I'll be going now.」
 Without giving me a chance to ask, Belle headed towards the choir team's lineup.

 After Belle exchanged greetings with the child at the end of the line beside her, I felt a sense of unease coming from her.
 v00an0700
 アンジ「(―What is she planning on doing?)」
 According to Mr. Helmer, she had gotten sick on the train because she'd overdosed on Drops.

 レイン「―It's the same as human medicine, if there's a mistake in the volume or the way it's used, the medicine becomes poisonous.」
 After remembering what he had said, I began to get worried. Still, I could only watch over her silently.
 
 The manager stood in front of the line, and gave a speech to the crowd explaining the choir's goals.
 v00an0701
 アンジ「...」
 Then, after all of the choir members bowed and lightly clapped their hands, they prepared to perform.

 v00an0702
 アンジ「...Ah!」
 I saw Belle slip the thing she was holding into her mouth.
 v00an0703
 アンジ「(―She...)」
 I have no idea what the effects of that stone are.
 But, if she reacted to it just like she had back on the train―
 
 v00an0704
 アンジ「(―Could it be that she only did this because I was pushing her too much?)」
 As a result of my expectations, she forced herself to do something like that.
 As I thought that, a sudden spike of guilt pierced my heart.
 sv028h
 v01be0539
 ベル「...La―, La―, La―」
 Before I knew it, the choir had already started.
 Amongst the many voices, I could clearly make out Belle's.
 sv028g
 v00an0705
 アンジ「(―Well, aren't you singing just fine.)」
 Still, I couldn't be unreservedly happy.
  That was because I had seen that Drop.
 
 
 sv028a
 v01be0540
 ベル「La―La―, La―」
 Belle's voice sounded near, yet distant.
 v00an0706
 アンジ「(―Is that singing voice truly your voice?)」
 
 I don't really know much about Schwesters yet.
 
 Just like I don't know much about Drops, either.
 But, the first time I saw her singing―
 Had she depended on the power of that stone?
 v00an0707
 アンジ「(―That's impossible.)」
 The day when we danced underneath the moonlight, she had sung naturally.
 ...If my deduction is correct, she had to swallow that Drop in order to sing successfully.
 
 
 
 
 v00an0708
 アンジ「(―Belle...)」

 Finally, when the choir had finished their song, the audience clapped.
 Among the satisfied smiles of the children in the choir, I saw Belle's expression relax.
 
 I hesitated for a moment before I clapped. I still couldn't get it out of my mind.
 
 Should I ask, or should I not?
 ...That thought had been swirling around inside my head.

 ココ「No good. I can't remember.」
 But I'd better find out where this is.
 coc_c01
 v02co0014
 ココ「Hmm. If I look outside, maybe I'll recognize it...」
 SE02C1
  I looked around for a window, and walked over to one.
 ...But I was too short to see outside.
 v02co0015
 ココ「Is there a chair around here?」
 As I glanced around, I saw one in the corner.
 coc_c03
 SE02C1
 v02co0016
 ココ「Heave, heave―」
 This chair isn't too heavy.
 SE01C
 I dragged the chair close to the window, then climbed up and sat on it.

 ココ「Heave, ho!」
 coc_c02
 v02co0018
 ココ「......」
 coc_c04

 This is no different from before.

 coc_c05
 v02co0021
 ココ「I, shouldn't do this, but―」
 coc_c01
 v02co0022
 ココ「First I'll take off my shoes―, then stand up on the chair―」
 Now I can finally see out the window―
 Bg51A02
 v02co0023
 ココ「Who, a―」
 K_BGM02A
 I saw lots and lots of rooftops, lining the streets below.
 v02co0024
 ココ「I wonder which one's my house?」
 I started looking for my house, beginning with the corner―
 ...but then realized I didn't know what it looked like.
 
 
 v02co0025
 ココ「What a pickle―」
 What should I do?
 Should I visit all the houses one by one?
 v02co0026
 ココ「But but, more importantly, how do I get down there?」
 It looks hard. I might even get lost down there.
 v02co0027
 ココ「―For, now...」
 Bg60A01
 I put the chair back where it was.
 K_BGM01C
 I'll get back into bed, and ask my pillow for advice!
 Maybe we'll think of something.

 Pat, pat, patpat!
 This is pretty fun, but―
 coc_c05
 v02co0029
 ココ「―I'm tired of it.」
 coc_c01
 There are toys in this room, but they might not be mine.
 If the toys aren't mine, I shouldn't play with them without asking, should I?
 
 coc_c05
 v02co0030
 ココ「Hmm...」
 With nothing left to do, I looked in the direction of the door.
 coc_c02
 v02co0031
 ココ「Is there another room, on the other side?」
 Or maybe a hallway?
 coc_c03
 v02co0032
 ココ「I'm curious...」
 Should I take a little peek?
 SE06A
 v02co0033
 ココ「Oof―」
 SE07A
 I opened the door, and peeked outside...
 coc_c02
 v02co0034
 ココ「Ah, it's a, hallway―」
 I glanced left and right. The hallway ran for a long distance.
 coc_c01
 v02co0035
 ココ「Hmm. If I leave, will I get in trouble?」
 coc_c08
 v02co0036
 ココ「I bet I would―」
 v02co0037
 ココ「But, but, it's no fun being all alone.」
 coc_c01
 If it gets dark and I'm still alone, what would I do?
 coc_c09
 v02co0038
 ココ「Scary―. That would be scary―!」
 I don't want to be alone.

 It was a long and wide hallway.
 Bg56A01
 v02co0039
 ココ「―Ugh, no one is here at all.」
 coc_c05
 I walked and walked along the hallway, but there was nobody in sight.
 
 v02co0040
 ココ「If I suddenly run into someone- What should I do?」
 coc_c04
 v02co0041
 ココ「......」
 If that happens―
 coc_c01
 v02co0042
 ココ「Should I say ‘good afternoon’?」
 I'm nervous, but I've got to greet them politely.
 Will I be able to bow?
 coc_c03
 v02co0043
 ココ「Good afternoon, good afternoon.」
 I faced the wall and practiced.
 coc_c08
 SE05A
 v02co0044
 ココ「Ouch!」
 I bumped my head.
 But, now I can do my greetings.
 coc_c01
 SE02C1
 v02co0045
 ココ「Right, let's go―!」
 I continued onwards until I reached the next corner.
 
 
 v02co0046
 ココ「Is anyone, here―?」
 ―There was no answer.
 coc_c04
 v02co0047
 ココ「Ugh, this is like hide and seek.」
 Seeking is hard work.
 I'm better at hiding than I am at seeking.
 coc_c07
 I just need to go into the bushes, crouch, and close my eyes.
 If I get poke-poked by someone... it's over.
 coc_c01
 v02co0048
 ココ「But, but, if I'm the first one to be found then it's my turn to do the seeking.」
 
 It would be nice if I got to hide all the time.
 Because the one who finds me always gives me a big smile.
 coc_c11
 v02co0049
 ココ「Ehehe―」
 Is everyone still playing hide and seek?
 I want to play with everyone too.
 coc_c04
 v02co0050
 ココ「Hmm, where are they―?」
 I paused in front of a door at the corner.
 
 
 Maybe there's somebody on the other side.
 coc_c01
 SE03C
 v02co0051
 ココ「Knock, knock. Is anyone home―?」
 ―No response.
 coc_c02
 v02co0052
 ココ「...Ah, maybe they're hiding?」
 If they were, no wonder they wouldn't reply.
 coc_c03
 v02co0053
 ココ「Umm, umm, I'm gonna open it―」
 SE07A
 The door wasn't locked.
 Bg57A01
 v02co0054
 ココ「Whoa, what a pretty, room―」
 Inside the room was a huge carpet.
 I was about to go in, but stopped myself. I might get in trouble if I did.
 Black450
 v02co0055
 ココ「Next―」
 SE08A
 Bg56A01
 I made sure the door was closed properly―
 coc_c04
 v02co0056
 ココ「Wha? Which way did I come from?」
 
 Was it from the left or the right?
 Have I gotten lost?
 coc_c02
 v02co0057
 ココ「Whoa, I got lost. This is bad―!」
 What should I do?
 coc_c03
 v02co0058
 ココ「...Oh well, I'm sure I'll remember this place eventually.」
 More importantly, I have to hurry and find somebody.
 I need to keep looking.
 Black450
 v02co0059
 コ「―This room's empty too.」
 SE02A1
 A wide room, then a narrow one.
  There were all kinds of rooms, but nobody was in any of them.
 Bg56A01
 coc_c02
 v02co0060
 ココ「What should I do? Should I go down the stairs I saw earlier?」
 Maybe there's someone downstairs.
 But― what if there isn't?
 coc_c04
 v02co0061
 ココ「Um, is anyone here―?」
 v21cr0001
 クリス「Coco―?」
 coc_c02
 v02co0062
 ココ「Whawa? Did someone say something?」
 
 I pricked up my ears.
 v21cr0002
 クリス「Where are you―?」
 coc_c04
 v02co0063
 ココ「Ah, um, which way is it coming from?」
 Maybe that way?
 Or this way?
 coc_c08
 v02co0064
 ココ「I'm in a pickle―」
 What should I do in a situation like this?
 v02co0065
 ココ「Um, um...」
 coc_c11
 v02co0066
 ココ「(―Ah, right. I should just stay where I am!)」
 It's hide and seek.
 If I stay where I am and don't move, someone will eventually find me.
 coc_c01
 v02co0067
 ココ「Oof―」
 I sat down and wrapped my arms around my knees.

 Then I closed my eyes and waited in excitement.
 Will somebody find me?
 .........

 v21cr0003
 クリス「―Thank goodness. So this is where you were hiding.」
 v02co0069
 ココ「(―I've been found!)」
 I slowly opened my eyes―
 ev901a
 v02co0070
 ココ「(―Who―, a―!)」
 Above me, there stood a beautiful girl in a dress.
 v02co0071
 ココ「(Whawa? Who could she be?)」
 
 As I tried to remember who she was, I noticed―
 v22ef0001
 エファ「―Coco?」
 The girl beside her, dressed in black, who called me Coco.
 v21cr0004
 クリス「We searched high and low for you, Coco.」
 Whawa?
 The one in the dress also calls me Coco.
 v02co0072
 ココ「Umm, umm― who might you be?」
 v21cr0005
 クリス「Eh?」
 She looked just like a princess from a castle in a picture book. But now she was startled.
 v21cr0006
 クリス「W-what should we do?」
 The princess glanced at the face of the girl beside her, said that, then turned her gaze to me once more.
 v02co0073
 ココ「(W, what should I do?)」
 In this situation―
 v02co0074
 ココ「Ah, that's right―!」
 At that moment, I remembered something I'd forgotten.
 I'd practiced for this, after all!
 v02co0075
 ココ「Good afternoon.」
 \nI first said that to the princess-like person before me.
 v21cr0007
 クリス「Indeed, good afternoon.」
 v02co0076
 ココ「Good afternoon.」
 \nNext, to the girl dressed in black.
 v22ef0002
 エファ「―G, good afternoon.」
 And now―
 v02co0077
 ココ「I'm sorry, I seem to be lost.」
 I bowed once more.
 v21cr0008
 クリス「You have no need to apologize, Coco.」
 v02co0078
 ココ「...‘Coco’?」
 v02co0079
 ココ「（―Why do I feel like I've heard that name before?)」
 v21cr0009
 クリス「That is your name. Have you forgotten?」
 v02co0080
 ココ「―Coco. My name, is Coco?」
 v21cr0010
 クリス「Indeed.」
 v02co0081
 ココ「（―Coco. Cocococo. Cococo?)」
 One, two, three... three ‘Co's’. No, only two.
 Yeah, yeah. There are two ‘Co's’ in Coco.
 v02co0082
 ココ「Yup. My name, is Coco. Yeah, yeah!」
 How mysterious a thing my name is.
 I only realized it when they called me that.
 v02co0083
 ココ「The princess, that looks like a princess, what's your name―?」
 v21cr0011
 クリス「My name... is Christina.」
 The princess looked sad as she said that.
 Whawa? I―
 
 v02co0084
 ココ「I don't know you, princess, but I feel like I've met you before...」
 v21cr0012
 クリス「That is correct. You used to call me ‘Princess.’」
 
 v02co0085
 ココ「Hmm, hmm.」
 \nNow that she mentions it, I feel like I did call her that.
 v21cr0013
 クリス「And this is Efa. Your friend.」
 v02co0086
 ココ「Efa, Efa...」
 \nI think I recall her―
 But, as I thought, I can't really remember a thing.
 v21cr0014
 クリス「Don't force yourself, Coco. Take your time, and your memories will slowly return to you.」
 
 v02co0087
 ココ「Kayy, I understand.」
 If the princess says so, I'm sure she's right.
 Because she always smiles as she speaks to me―
 v02co0088
 ココ「―Ah! I already remembered a little―」
 v22ef0003
 エファ「Really?」
 \nThe girl beside her, called Efa, brightened up a bit.
 v02co0089
 ココ「Yeah, yeah!」
 That's right!
  I was brought to this castle, where I met Efa and the princess.
 v02co0090
 ココ「Umm, umm. I am... a, doll...」
 The princess teaches me lots of things.
 Efa is also a doll, like me. But she's a bit different.
 Because Efa is―
 v25du0001
 デュア「Princess! Princess, where are you?」
 
 v02co0091
 ココ「Who―, a―?!」
 Suddenly, I heard a woman's voice.
  I looked around, but couldn't see anyone other than the princess and Efa.

 v02co0092
 ココ「Who was that, just now―?」

 v02co0093
 ココ「Body-guard? Dua―?」
 
 v02co0094
 ココ「（―Who's that?)」
 v22ef0004
 エファ「Dua is the knight who keeps guard over the princess.」
 v02co0095
 ココ「That's amazing, really amazing!」
 I know about them.
 Knights, I've heard of them!
 I've seen them in picture books.
 v02co0096
 ココ「The ones who fight dragons, right?」
 v21cr0016
 クリス「Ufufu. She doesn't fight dragons, but she is the most skilled warrior in our kingdom.」
 Like I thought, she's incredible!
 v25du0003
 デュア「―Princess! Where are...」
 v22ef0005
 エファ「...Um, it sounds like she's going to pass us by.」
 v21cr0017
 クリス「―How troublesome. I am not finished speaking with Coco yet.」
 
 v22ef0006
 エファ「Your Highness. Judging from her voice, perhaps it is a matter of urgency?」
 v21cr0018
 クリス「―That may be so.」
 The princess considered Efa's words.
 v21cr0019
 クリス「Then, Efa. May I leave Coco in your care?」
 v22ef0007
 エファ「Of course, if that is your wish.」
 v21cr0020
 クリス「Then, please. I'm sorry, Coco. I must attend to Dua.」
 
 v02co0097
 ココ「Kayy―」
 v22ef0008
 エファ「Take care, Your Highness.」
 The princess smiled.

 Then walked away, leaving me with Efa.

 v02co0099
 ココ「Efa, you are a doll too, right?」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0010
 エファ「That's right.」
 As I'd thought. But Efa was a bit different.
 There was a wind-up key in my back, but―
 v02co0100
 ココ「Don't you have a wind-up key, Efa?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0011
 エファ「I don't.」
 v02co0101
 ココ「I, do―」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0012
 エファ「How nice.」
 v02co0102
 ココ「Do you want it? Should I give it to you?」
 
 efa_a01
 v22ef0013
 エファ「No, you mustn't. That belongs to you, Coco.」
 Efa shook her head with a smile.
 v02co0103
 エファ「So you don't have a wind-up key at all, Efa?」
 v22ef0014
 エファ「No, I don't. But I have―」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0015
 エファ「These wings.」
 v02co0104
 ココ「If you have wings, you don't need a wind-up key?」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0016
 エファ「You're almost right. But that isn't quite it.」
 v02co0105
 ココ「??」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0017
 エファ「We dolls are Angels of the Tenth Rank.」
 v02co0106
 ココ「Tenth Rank?」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0018
 エファ「Coco, do you know of the Angels?」
 v02co0107
 ココ「Nuh-uh.」
 v22ef0019
 エファ「They say that the Angels created by God range from the first to the ninth rank.」
 
 Ninth?
 v22ef0020
 エファ「But you and I, Coco, were created by humans.」
 v02co0108
 ココ「(―‘Ninth’ means the number nine, right?)」
 
 
 efa_a03
 v22ef0021
 エファ「Then we were offered to God, and joined the ranks of the Angels ― as the tenth rank.」
 
 v02co0109
 ココ「(―Tenth?)」
 
 
 v02co0110
 ココ「...Hmm―」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0022
 エファ「Do you understand?」
 v02co0111
 ココ「Ten comes after nine, right?」
 ココ「What are ranks?」
 
 
 
 efa_a03
 v22ef0023
 エファ「That's correct.」
 But―
 v02co0112
 
 efa_a01
 v22ef0024
 エファ「Perhaps it's a scale of greatness... in any case, it just means an order of numbers.」
 
 v02co0113
 ココ「Hmm. That means, the tenth rank is―」
 
 One, two, three, four...
 v02co0114
 ココ「Is being in the tenth rank great?」
 v22ef0025
 エファ「It is.」
 Ehehe. I can still count ten with my fingers.
 v22ef0026
 エファ「―You know how angels have wings, right?」
 
 
 v02co0115
 ココ「Yeah, yeah.」
 \nI've seen them in picture books, so I knew what she meant.
 efa_a02
 v22ef0027
 エファ「That is why wings were endowed upon us.」
 v02co0116
 ココ「Ah. Wings like the ones on your back, Efa―」
 A pair of beautiful white wings.
 v22ef0028
 エファ「These are the proof that we are dolls.
 v02co0117
 ココ「―Whawa?」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0029
 エファ「What's wrong?」
 v02co0118
 ココ「But, I don't, have wings.」
 v22ef0030
 エファ「That's not true. You have wings, too.」
 When she told me that, I felt my back, but I still couldn't find any wings.
 efa_a03
 v22ef0031
 エファ「That wind-up key is in place of your wings.」
 v02co0119
 ココ「Is it―?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0032
 エファ「See, how it's shaped like the wings of a butterfly? That's why this key is your wings.」
 
 
 
 v02co0120
 ココ「I see―」
 \nBefore I go to bed tonight, I'll take it out and have a closer look.
 v02co0121
 ココ「But, you're amazing―」
 v22ef0033
 エファ「Eh, why?」
 v02co0122
 ココ「You know, so much, Efa―」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0034
 エファ「T, that's not true.」
 Efa shook her head in denial.
 v22ef0035
 エファ「I don't know much of anything else, after all...」
 v02co0123
 ココ「You don't?」
 v22ef0036
 エファ「No...」
 v02co0124
 ココ「Well, well―」
 What should I ask?
 v02co0125
 ココ「What do you like, to eat?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0037
 エファ「What do I like to eat? Hmm, I'll eat anything that's delicious. What about you, Coco?」
 
 v02co0126
 ココ「Umm, meat. Efa, do you, like meat?」
 I like meat.
 v22ef0038
 エファ「I don't dislike it.」
 If she doesn't dislike it, does that mean she likes it?
 v02co0127
 ココ「Well, what do you dislike?」
 v22ef0039
 エファ「Food, you mean? I wouldn't say I dislike them, but...」
 
 efa_a04
 v22ef0040
 エファ「I can't handle spicy things.」
 v02co0128
 ココ「Can't handle?」
 v22ef0041
 エファ「It's not something I'm good at. I can eat spicy things, but I'd prefer not to.」
 
 So ‘can't handle’ means ‘not good at.’
 efa_a01
 v22ef0042
 エファ「What about you, Coco?」
 v02co0129
 ココ「Um, things I can't handle?」
 v22ef0043
 エファ「That's right, things you can't handle.」
 Food I can't handle is food I don't want to eat, right?
 v02co0130
 ココ「...I can't handle carrots, and peppers.」
 v02co0131
 ココ「(...Oh no, I've said it―)」

 v02co0132
 ココ「They are?」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0045
 エファ「I think they're delicious.」
 v02co0133
 ココ「......」
 But I'm a doll, just like Efa.
 efa_a05
 Is something wrong with me?
 efa_a04
 v22ef0046
 エファ「Coco, it's nothing to look so sad over.」
 v02co0134
 ココ「But Efa is fine with them, and yet I can't handle them. How embarrassing...」
 
 efa_a01
 v22ef0047
 エファ「I'm sure if you wait a little longer, Coco, you'll be able to eat them someday too.」
 
 v02co0135
 ココ「Really―?」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0048
 エファ「―Yes.」
 Efa thought about it for a bit, then nodded.
 efa_a02
 v22ef0049
 エファ「When you grow up into an adult, you'll find them delicious too.」
 v02co0136
 ココ「Adult? After lots of birthdays?」
 
 efa_a01
 v22ef0050
 エファ「Not a lot. I think a couple of years will be enough.」
 v02co0137
 ココ「I see―」
 v22ef0051
 エファ「You'll eventually overcome your dislikes.」
 v02co0138
 ココ「Overcome?」
 v22ef0052
 エファ「It means you'll no longer be unable to handle it?」
 v02co0139
 ココ「I'll be able to handle carrots and peppers?」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0053
 エファ「―Probably.」
 I see. Just a bit longer, and I'll be fine with carrots and peppers too.
 v02co0140
 ココ「I hope I'll be able to handle them soon―」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0054
 エファ「But, Coco.」
 v02co0141
 ココ「?」
 v22ef0055
 エファ「Just having a lot of birthdays won't make you an adult.」
 v02co0142
 ココ「Is that so―?」
 v22ef0056
 エファ「If you eat even things that you dislike―」
 v02co0143
 ココ「If I do that―?」
 v22ef0057
 エファ「Then you will become an adult.」
 v02co0144
 ココ「Really―?!」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0058
 エファ「Yes. So bear with it and eat even the food you don't like as well, okay?」
 I'm not good at bearing with it, but I want to become an adult―
 v02co0145
 ココ「―Ugh. I'll, try.」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0059
 エファ「Do that. I'm cheering for you.」
 v02co0146
 ココ「If I can eat everything, no one will be angry with me, will they?」
 v22ef0060
 エファ「Even if there's nothing left, I'm sure no one will be angry.」
 v02co0147
 ココ「So if I manage to eat all my food, I can tell, everyone?」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0061
 エファ「Yes. If you start to enjoy your food, please let me be the first to hear about it.」
 
 v02co0148
 ココ「Yeah, yeah. But until then, the things I hate, are a secret, okay―」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0062
 エファ「Okay. It's a promise.」
 Efa smiled at me. Ehehe.
 Until I can eat everything, Efa will keep the things I dislike a secret.
 v02co0149
 ココ「Um, um. Can I ask you, about, other things you like?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0063
 エファ「Yes, of course.」
 v02co0150

 ココ「Dandelions―!」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0065
 エファ「I also like dandelions.」
 v02co0152
 ココ「Really? Ehehe―」
 
 I can look at dandelions all day and not get bored.
 v02co0153
 ココ「Then, then, what about, your favorite animal?」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0066
 エファ「―Birds, perhaps?」
 v02co0154
 ココ「Why?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0067
 エファ「Because they're able to fly in the sky.」
 v02co0155
 ココ「Ah―」
 They can flap their wings and soar high in the air.
 v02co0156
 ココ「You have wings too, Efa. Can you fly, in the sky?」
 v22ef0068
 エファ「―I can't. But I can move them.」
 v02co0157
 ココ「Can you flap your wings?」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0069
 エファ「Just a bit.」
 Amazing!
 v02co0158
 ココ「My wind-up key, doesn't flap.」
 v22ef0070
 エファ「It goes round and round instead, right?」
 v02co0159
 ココ「Round and round and round―」
 SE02B1
 I love spinning around.
 efa_a03
 v22ef0071
 エファ「You look like you're having fun, Coco.」
 v02co0160
 ココ「Yeah, yeah. I like spinning. Do you like spinning, Efa?」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0072
 エファ「I do. As long as I don't get dizzy.」
 v02co0161
 ココ「Yeah―」
 SE02B1
 Round and round.
 efa_a01
 I wonder if the princess likes to spin around too?
 v02co0162
 ココ「Hey, hey, Efa...」
 I wanted to ask her about the princess.
 SE09A1
 efa_a05
 v22ef0073
 エファ「―Ah, wait.」
 But Efa was looking across the hallway.
 v02co0163
 ココ「What's wrong?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0074
 エファ「I can hear footsteps.」
 The sound of footsteps was approaching near.
 v02co0164
 ココ「Is it the princess?」
 v22ef0075
 エファ「―No, it's not her.」
 v02co0165
 ココ「I wonder who it is?」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0076
 エファ「That's... Ein.」
 Black450
 v02co0166

 Who is Ein?

 アイン「Good afternoon, Coco.」
 v02co0167
 ココ「Good, afternoon.」
 I bowed to Ein, just like I'm supposed to.
 v02co0168
 ココ「(―It's okay to call him ‘Ein,’ right?)」
 v02co0169
 ココ「Ein?」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0002
 アイン「That's right.」
 He was wearing a long black coat― and his hair was almost as long as it was.
 I wonder whose hair is longer, his or the princess's?
 
 ein_b05
 v24ei0003
 アイン「Is something the matter?」
  he asked me, seeming surprised.
 ein_b04
 v24ei0004
 アイン「Could you have forgotten about me?」
 He knows my name, but... who is Ein to me?
 
 v02co0170
 ココ「Ugh, I'm sorry.」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0005
 ココ「It's quite all right. No need to apologize. I've heard about what happened from the Lady.」
 
 v02co0171
 ココ「The Lady?」
 v22ef0077
 エファ「He means the princess,」
 \nEfa whispered to me.
 v02co0172
 ココ「Ah, the princess―」
 ein_b01
 So Ein calls the princess ‘the Lady.’
 v02co0173
 ココ「Did the princess tell you about me?」
 ein_b07
 v24ei0006
 アイン「Hm? Well, not that much, but―」
 
 v02co0174
 ココ「?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0007
 アイン「Milady told me that you were an interesting one.」
 v02co0175
 ココ「I am, interesting?」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0008
 アイン「Why not try searching your heart for the answer?」
 Okay, I got it!
 I'll try that.
 v02co0176
 ココ「Am I, interesting?」
 \nI put my hands on my heart, and waited excitedly for the answer!
 v02co0177
 ココ「(―Hmmm?)」
 v02co0178
 ココ「―I still don't really, know―」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0009
 アイン「―It's okay, you can put your hands down now. You are quite interesting enough already.」
 Ein smiled in a slightly troubled manner. Did he really think I was interesting?
 I was just searching my heart for the answer...
 ein_b01
 v24ei0010
 アイン「―By the way, Coco.」
 v02co0179
 ココ「Yess?」
 v24ei0011
 アイン「What are you doing out here in the hallway?」
 v02co0180
 ココ「Umm―」
 \nWhat was I doing here again?
 He'd asked so suddenly that I couldn't answer.
 ein_b02
 v24ei0012
 アイン「Were you playing?」
 v02co0181
 ココ「I-I wasn't.」
 ein_b04
 Ein was staring at me fixedly.
 v24ei0013
 アイン「Were you taking a stroll with Efa?」
 v02co0182
 ココ「Umm, umm...」
 \nW-w-what should I say?
 v24ei0014
 アイン「Or perhaps you're exploring the keep?」
 v02co0183
 ココ「Keep?」
 v22ef0078
 エファ「The inside of the castle.」
 \nEfa saved me again.
 v02co0184
 ココ「Ah, this is a castle―」
 So that's why the princess is here.
 ein_b01
 v24ei0015
 アイン「If there's anywhere you would like to go, shall I show you the way?」
 Whoa, the conversation still isn't over?
 v02co0185
 ココ「Um, uh...」
 Ein's narrow eyes scared me.
 So much that I couldn't answer him properly-
 v22ef0079
 エファ「―Coco left her room and got lost. Isn't that right?」
 v02co0186
 ココ「Y, yeah.」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0016
 アイン「I see, and then?」
 v02co0187
 ココ「Um, ah―」
 v22ef0080
 エファ「And then you found the princess and had a chat with her until now, yes?」
 v02co0188
 ココ「Yeah!」
 v24ei0017
 アイン「And where has Milady gone?」
 v02co0189
 ココ「Er...」
 v22ef0081
 エファ「Dua was calling for her, so she went over to meet her.」
 v02co0190
 ココ「Yup yup, that's right!」
 Ein's questions are hard, but Efa is answering them.
 This is easy peasy! I'll leave it all to Efa.
 ein_b04
 v24ei0018
 アイン「Dua, was it...」
 Ah, Ein's lost in thought.
 Ehehe, I'll try imitating him.
 v02co0191
 ココ「Dua, was, it―」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0019
 アイン「...Hmm?」
 v22ef0082
 エファ「...What's wrong, Coco?」
 v02co0192
 ココ「―Whawa?」
 \nThe two of them were looking at me.
 v24ei0020
 アイン「Coco? Did something happen to Dua?」
 
 v02co0193
 ココ「I don't, know Dua.」
 ein_b04
 v24ei0021
 アイン「Hm?」
 v02co0194
 ココ「Awawa. Who, is Dua?」
 What should I do? He's looking at me with those scary eyes again.
 v22ef0083
 エファ「Coco hasn't met Dua since then.」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0022
 アイン「―Ah. So that is the reason.」
 v02co0195
 ココ「Yup, yup, that's right.」
 As Ein nodded his head, I followed suit.
 Upon seeing me do that, Ein said to Efa,
 ein_b05
 v24ei0023
 アイン「―It seems she does not understand, but I suppose that is fine.」
 
 Thank goodness.
  When I imitated him, he had smiled a little.
 ein_b01
 v24ei0024
 アイン「―Then, can you find your way back to your room on your own?」
 v02co0196
 ココ「Find your way back?」
 \nI imitated Ein, directing his question to Efa.
 efa_a05
 v22ef0084
 エファ「Eh? Are you asking me?」
 
 v02co0197
 ココ「Asking me?」
 \nI imitated Efa, directing her question to Ein.
 ein_b02
 v24ei0025
 アイン「Actually, I am asking you.」
 v02co0198
 ココ「I am asking you.」
 \nAt Efa again.
 efa_a05
 v22ef0085
 エファ「Eh? That question is not for me to answer―」
 
 v22ef0086a
 エファ「The one who should answer that is you, Coco.」
 エファ「You are the one who must answer that, Coco.」
 coc_c05
 Whoa, they said the same thing at the same time!
 coc_c06
 v02co0199
 ココ「Who, should I imitate, now―?」
 I'm stumped. I'm totally stumped!
 ein_b05
 v24ei0027
 アイン「―Phew. You don't have to imitate us any longer.」
 ―Ah, Ein smiled.
 v24ei0028
 アイン「...That aside, before you return to your room, there is something I must confirm.」
 
 v02co0200
 ココ「What is it―?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0029
 アイン「Do you remember anything about where you came from or who you are?」
 v22ef0087
 エファ「Ein, Coco's memory is not yet―」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0030
 アイン「Be at ease. I will ask no more than is necessary.」
 Ein reached out his hand about Efa as he spoke.
 v22ef0088
 エファ「...Very well, I understand.」
 I don't really get it. I guess it's something only they themselves are able to understand.
 ein_b01
 v24ei0031
 アイン「―Then. Well, Coco? Do you remember where you came from?」
 
 Where I came from?
 v02co0201
 ココ「Hmmm, I, don't―」
 v24ei0032
 アイン「What about where you are right now?」
 v02co0202
 ココ「Hmm, hmm. A castle―?」
 v24ei0033
 アイン「That is correct. This kingdom is the White Kingdom and this is Dornstein Castle - oft known simply as the ‘White Castle.’」
 
 v02co0203
 ココ「The White Castle―」
 v24ei0034
 アイン「The lord of this castle is Princess Christina.」
 v02co0204
 ココ「Princess―」
 v24ei0035
 アイン「And, you came from the Blue Kingdom to the east ― from Blew.」
 v02co0205
 ココ「(―Blew?)」
 v24ei0036
 アイン「Efa here is from the Red Kingdom to the west ― a place called Cardinal.」
 
 v02co0206
 ココ「I'm, from the Blue Kingdom?」
 v24ei0037
 アイン「Yes.」
 v02co0207
 ココ「Efa, is from the Red Kingdom―?」
 v22ef0089
 エファ「I am.」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0038
 アイン「The two of you were invited here to Dornstein Castle as guests.」
 So that's how it is―
 ein_b01
 v24ei0039
 アイン「If there is anything you still do not understand, please ask.」
 v02co0208
 ココ「Yup! I have a question―」
 v24ei0040
 アイン「Go ahead.」
 v02co0209
 ココ「Who is Ein?」
 ein_b03
 v24ei0041
 アイン「...I am Ein.」
 v02co0210
 ココ「Ah, that's not what I meant.」
 ...I messed up.
 v02co0211
 ココ「What, does Ein, do―?」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0042
 アイン「I am Milady's steward― perhaps you understand that much?」
 v02co0212
 ココ「Ste-ward? I, don't.」
 
 ein_b01
 v24ei0043
 アイン「Until the Lady becomes a full-fledged queen, I am the one who assists her in various matters.」
 
 v02co0213
 ココ「Helper?」
 v24ei0044
 アイン「That's right.」
 v02co0214
 ココ「So, Ein is, a servant?」
 v22ef0090
 エファ「―That's wrong, Coco. Ein is a very noble person.」
 Efa tugged at my hand slightly.
 v02co0215
 ココ「Hmmm...?」
 v22ef0091
 エファ「After the princess, Ein is the next most important personage in this kingdom.」
 v02co0216
 ココ「Is that so?」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0045
 アイン「―For the time being, anyway.」
 v02co0217
 ココ「You are amazing―, Ein―!」
 v24ei0046
 アイン「On the contrary, it's a great deal of work and responsibility.」
 Ein shook his head and smiled sadly.
 v02co0218
 ココ「Is work, hard?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0047
 アイン「I would say it's important, more so than hard.」
 v02co0219
 ココ「Impor-tant―」
 v24ei0048
 アイン「As it happens, I have an important task for the two of you.」
 v02co0220
 ココ「Eh―?」
 ein_b03
 v24ei0049
 アイン「Have you forgotten?」
 v02co0221
 ココ「...Like, cleaning my room―?」
 v24ei0050
 アイン「No, the play.」
  Whoa, he's staring at me again.
 v02co0222
 ココ「Play―?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0051
 アイン「Indeed. The two of you were summoned here to perform on stage with Milady.」
 v02co0223
 ココ「Hmm, hmm.」
 I'm here to perform with the princess?
 I wonder what kind of play it is?
 Maybe the kind where the princess gets kidnapped, and I'll go to rescue her?
 That sounds impossible for me, though.
 v24ei0052
 アイン「The two of you are main characters.」
 v02co0224
 ココ「Eh―! Efa, is that true?」
 
 efa_a05
 v22ef0092
 エファ「―Eh? You could say that, yes...」
 
 Efa nodded, surprised.
 For some reason, it didn't seem like she was paying attention to the conversation.
 She hadn't spoken for a while.
 v02co0225
 ココ「What's wrong, Efa?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0093
 エファ「What do you mean?」
 v02co0226
 ココ「You don't, look well.」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0094
 エファ「...Mm.」
 v02co0227
 ココ「Is it because, I've been talking too much?」
 v22ef0095
 エファ「No.」
 \nEfa looked uneasy.
 v24ei0053
 アイン「―Efa. Are you concerned for the Lady?」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0096
 エファ「There is that, too.」
 That too... does that mean there's something else on her mind?
 v02co0228
 ココ「Efa, do you need to go to the toilet?」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0097
 エファ「―I don't.」
 v02co0229
 ココ「Then, are you looking for something?」
 efa_a03
 v22ef0098
 エファ「―That's not it.」
 v02co0230
 ココ「Then, then―」
 v02co0231
 ココ「(―Hmm.)」
 v02co0232
 ココ「What could it be?」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0099
 エファ「―Coco, you see...」
 Efa sighed, then glanced at Ein.
 v22ef0100
 エファ「It feels difficult for me to be here.」
 v02co0233
 ココ「Why―?」
 v22ef0101
 エファ「―Because, I'm not... good with being around Ein.」
 It's because of Ein?
 v02co0234
 ココ「Is that so?」
 It must be painful to hear that someone else isn't good at being around you.
 Even for Ein―
 v24ei0054
 アイン「Efa.」
 v22ef0102
 エファ「...Yes.」
 v24ei0055
 アイン「It's about time you went to the Lady's side.」
 Whawa?
 Ein doesn't look sad at all.
 v22ef0103
 エファ「―But, I'm supposed to remain with Coco, not the princess...」
 v24ei0056
 アイン「I would hope you will entrust me with Coco.」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0104
 エファ「―Understood. Then, please look after Coco for me.」
 
 v02co0235
 ココ「Look after me?」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0105
 エファ「I'm sorry, Coco. Until next we meet.」
 v02co0236
 ココ「Kay.」
 Efa bowed her head to me and Ein, then turned and headed down the hallway.
 Once she turned a corner, and her fluttering white wings left our sight, Ein spoke.
 ein_b01
 v24ei0057
 アイン「Perhaps she hates me?」 he said.
 
 v02co0237
 ココ「She said, she's ‘not good’ at being around you.」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0058
 アイン「Yes, quite frank of her.」
 v02co0238
 ココ「Are you sad, Ein?」
 ein_b07
 v24ei0059
 アイン「I'm not particularly sad, but―」
 Ein stroked his chin, as if he were an old man.
 v02co0239
 ココ「?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0060
 アイン「―By the way, Coco, what about you?」
 v02co0240
 ココ「What, is it―?」
 v24ei0061
 アイン「Are you all right with being around me?」
 Being around Ein?
 Efa's not good at it, but what about me?
 v02co0241
 ココ「(―I'm a little bit bad with it, I guess?)」
 v02co0242
 ココ「...Hmm. I, don't know.」
 Even if I'm bad, I mustn't say it out loud.
 Because, anyone would be sad to hear that.
 ein_b02
 v24ei0062
 アイン「...You don't know, huh.」
 v02co0243
 ココ「Yup.」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0063
 アイン「You're very kind, Coco.」
 v02co0244
 ココ「E-eh?」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0064
 アイン「Thank you for being considerate.」
 Why is he patting me on the head?
  I don't really get it, but I'm happy. Ehehe.
 v02co0245
 ココ「Ah, but but but―」
 ein_b01
 v02co0246
 ココ「Efa, doesn't hate you, you know―」
 v24ei0065
 アイン「―Why do you think that?」
 v02co0247
 ココ「Because, she said ‘not good.’」
 ein_b02
 v24ei0066
 アイン「Hmm?」
 v02co0248
 ココ「She doesn't hate you, just isn't good with you. In a little while, she'll be fine―」
 v24ei0067
 アイン「Is that so?」
 v02co0249
 ココ「...Maybe. When she becomes an adult―」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0068
 アイン「Hahaha.」
 Whawa?
 Why is he laughing?
 v24ei0069
 アイン「―When she becomes an adult, huh.」
 v02co0250
 ココ「Yeah, yeah.」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0070
 アイン「You see, Efa can't act like you.」
 v02co0251
 ココ「Like me―?」
 v24ei0071
 アイン「Efa is different from you. She cannot lie.」
 Efa can't lie, and that's different from me?
 v02co0252
 ココ「―Does that mean, Efa is honest but I'm, a liar?」
 
 v24ei0072
 アイン「No, no, not that. I'm sorry for confusing you.」
 ein_b03
 v24ei0073
 アイン「By 'she cannot lie', I mean she cannot avoid being honest.」
 
 v02co0253
 ココ「No matter what―?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0074
 アイン「She was created in such a way that, when asked a question, she must reply honestly.」
 v02co0254
 ココ「Hmm―」
 v24ei0075
 アイン「Coco, do you always tell the truth?」
 v02co0255
 ココ「Umm, umm. That's hard to answer.」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0076
 アイン「Well, that was a honest answer too in a way.」
 v02co0256
 ココ「?」
 v24ei0077
 アイン「You found it hard to say directly. That's why you said it was hard to reply.」
 
 v02co0257
 ココ「...?」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0078
 アイン「That might still be hard for you to understand, I guess.」
 v02co0258
 ココ「Mm, but but, it's good to be honest, right?」
 
 v24ei0079
 アイン「Depending on the time and place, everyone has secrets they don't want others to discover, right?」
 
 v02co0259
 ココ「Hmm, I wonder―?」
 I don't really get it, but―
 v02co0260
 ココ「Maybe you're right―」
 ein_b05
 v24ei0080
 アイン「Indeed, indeed.」
 Ein relaxed, making him look more gentle than before.
 v24ei0081
 アイン「Then, Coco.」
 v02co0261
 ココ「Yes.」
 ein_b01
 v24ei0082
 アイン「―What kind of secret are you keeping from me?」
 v02co0262
 ココ「Eh―?」
 Ein leaned forwards, staring at me intently.
 This time, he's really scary...
 v02co0263
 ココ「Can I, not say?」
 v24ei0083
 アイン「If you would tell me, that would make me happy. But I will not force you.」
 v02co0264
 ココ「Umm, what should I do?」
 Should I say it?
  If it's Ein, would I tell him?
 Will he get mad?
 v02co0265
 ココ「Umm, umm.」
 v02co0266
 ココ「Ein, do you, like peppers―?」
 ein_b03
 v24ei0084
 アイン「Peppers?」
 v02co0267
 ココ「Yeah.」
 If he says he loves them, I'll keep it a secret.
  Because if I say that I don't like them, I'll upset those who do.
 
 ein_b05
 v24ei0085
 アイン「Peppers, eh...」
 Why is Ein smiling?
 Does he like them?
 Does he hate them?
 v02co0268
 ココ「Then, then, what about carrots?」
 SE03A
 ―Knock, knock.
 Whawa?
 What was that knocking sound just now?
 ein_b01
 v24ei0086
 アイン「I'm sorry, Coco. Do you mind if I give you an answer later?」
 v02co0269
 ココ「?」

 Suddenly, a woman loomed over my head and spoke.

 She was a woman, but she was dressed like a man.
 A sheathed sword hung from her belt.

 Ein sounds a lot gentler.
 v24ei0093

 デュア「Yes. That matter regarding the working conditions of the Royal Guard I brought to your attention last week, I'm here to give you the report―」

 v25du0014
 デュア「Would you like to read it?」
 v24ei0095
 アイン「I've already seen it.」

 Awawa, Dua is angry. This is bad.

 dua_b05
 v25du0021
 デュア「Ah, no, I mean, you didn't have to say that―」
 v24ei0103
 アイン「...On that note, I'm returning to my office.」
 dua_b03
 v25du0022
 デュア「Wha?!」
 v24ei0104
 アイン「After all, Dua, I must give your report a proper perusal.」
 dua_b04
 As Ein addressed her, Dua looked exhausted.
 v25du0023
 デュア「...Understood. Then I shall accompany you.」
 v24ei0105
 アイン「No, that won't be necessary. Instead...」
 
 Ein glanced over at me.
 v24ei0106
 アイン「I would like you to take Coco back to her room.」
 v25du0024
 デュア「―Is that an order?」
 v24ei0107

 v02co0280
 ココ「It sounds harsh.」
 v25du0030
 デュア「Phew. Well, he does have an enormous responsibility looming ahead of him, so it's only to be expected that he would postpone a matter like that one.」
 
 Somehow, Dua looked depressed.
  Poor thing. I wonder if she'll cheer up if I give her a pat?
 v02co0281

 \nShe thanked me.

 Dua was about to say something, but she stopped. Now she's lost in thought again.

 v25du0039
 デュア「Never mind. I am worrying myself out.」
 She nodded, as if she had settled something.
 v25du0040
 デュア「Well, now that I've sorted that out. Let's go to your room, Coco.」
 v02co0288

 I followed behind Dua.

 I nodded!

 A me on top of myself?

 dua_b02

 v02co0301
 ココ「Do you like, Ein―?」
 v25du0055

 Oh?
 Looking terribly surprised, Dua turned her head away.
 v02co0302
 ココ「You hate him―?」
 v25du0056
 デュア「It's not that I hate him...」
 v02co0303

 Dua looked happy and troubled at the same time.

 v25du0063
 デュア「―Right. This is your room. I'll open the door for you.」
 v02co0309
 ココ「Wow, it is―」
 I remember it now.
  This was the room I came out into the hallway from.
 v02co0310
 ココ「Thank you, very much.」
 v25du0064

 v02co0313

 v25du0067

 As she said that, Dua reached towards my head.
 Ah, could it be she wants to pat me?
 v25du0068
 デュア「―Today was fun, Coco.」
 v02co0314
 ココ「Ehehe, for me too!」
 v25du0069
 デュア「...Fufu.」
 Whawa?
 She didn't pat me.
 Instead,
 dua_b01
 v25du0070
 デュア「Let's shake hands.」
 \nDua offered me her hand.
 v02co0315
 ココ「Okay, let's―」
 \nI shook hands with Dua.
 v25du0071
 デュア「―Well then, till we meet again.」
 v02co0316
 ココ「Yep, bye bye―」
 Dua glanced back at me several times as she headed off.
 I'm lonely now.
 v02co0317
 ココ「(―But, but...)」
 Dua was smiling as she looked back at me.
 That makes me a little happy too.

 アンジ「...My apologies for disturbing your rest.」
 There was a girl standing on stage all by herself.
  She should have been Angelina, whom I knew all too well.
 Yet she had an aura like that of a true princess, even though she was not wearing the clothes that a princess would.
 
 st00_c07
 v00an0963
 アンジ「Sorry for calling you out on a day where you should be resting from the practice.」
 v07to0417
 トニー「No, it's fine. Don't you need to rest too?」
 st00_c00
 v00an0964
 アンジ「Well, even though I wanted to take it easy today, once I found out that nobody was using the theater―」
 
 Angelina had phoned me about thirty minutes ago.
 
 Since Silvia was out shopping and I was bored all by myself, I accepted her request and came to the theater.
 
 st00_c01
 v00an0965
 アンジ「―After asking the person in charge, I found out that it was because that another troupe canceled their plans for a rehearsal. So I asked him the permission to use the theater, and he said it was okay.」
 
 v07to0418
 トニー「So that's why you wanted me to come... what about Wakaba and the others?」
 st00_c00
 v00an0966
 アンジ「The siblings said they needed to help out at home, and asked Belle to help them out. They need a change of mood once in a while, right?」
 
 v07to0419
 トニー「I guess. And I bet Cero is doing some research or something, right?」
 st00_c04
 v00an0967
 アンジ「Bingo. Yesterday, he said that the book he ordered just arrived.」
 Looks like everyone is busy with their own business. 
 ...And that I'm the only one who has so much free time.
 st00_c08
 v00an0968
 アンジ「Are you sure this is all right?」
 v07to0420
 トニー「Yeah, of course. Since Silvia went out and I have nothing better to do.」
 
 v07to0421
 トニー「But there aren't many scenes with us both together that we can rehearse. If you're fine with that, I'm happy to help.」
 
 st00_c01
 v00an0969
 アンジ「Of course.」
 v07to0422
 トニー「...Alright, since we're here to practice, I'll go change into my costume.」
 black450
 bg20a01
 With the thought that I shouldn't take too long, I swiftly changed my clothes and headed back to the stage.
 
 v07to0423
 トニー「We only have Valery's costume at the moment, but it should work out if you just think of me as Ein.」
 
 The role that had the most scenes on stage with the princess was Ein.
 I'm able to change between the two characters, just like a light switch, but it's about time I focused on a single role.
 
 st00_c00
 v00an0970
 アンジ「Then, could we practice my scenes with Ein?」
 v07to0424
 トニー「Okay, which scene do you want to do?」
 v00an0971
 アンジ「...The scene where it's reported that the conference of the three kingdoms has been canceled.」
 As she said that, she walked to the edge of the stage.
 Usually, we would be practicing as others watched, but right now it was just me and Angelina...
 
 v07to0425
 トニー「(―Or rather... Princess Christina.)」
 I'm certain that Angelina will do justice to the role of the princess in The Angel's Guidance.
 
 st00_c00
 v00an0972
 アンジ「Now, let us begin from the moment when I visit Ein's office.」
 She entered her role and switched her tone of voice to that of a princess.
 I too must be more like the stern retainer that I am. With that thought, I took a deep breath and nodded to signal that we should start.
 
 st00_c02
 v00an0973
 アンジ「...Ein, what is the situation concerning the conference between the three kingdoms?」
 v07to0426
 トニー「Pardon me for overstepping my boundaries, I have canceled it of my own accord.」
 
 st00_c09
 v00an0974
 アンジ「...What is the meaning of this?
 This castle is already surrounded by the troops of the Red and Blue Kingdoms.」
 
 v00an0975
 アンジ「This was the final chance for a diplomatic solution. Why have you thrown it away?」
 
 v07to0427
 トニー「Pardon my rudeness, but that is not how it was.」
 v07to0428
 トニー「―From the very beginning, diplomacy was never an option afforded to us.」
 st00_c08
 v00an0976
 アンジ「What do you mean?」
 Faced with the astounded princess, Ein raised his head.
 v07to0429
 トニー「The Red and Blue Kingdom have already been talking in secret.」
 v07to0430
 トニー「Those talks concern how they shall split the land of our White Kingdom once they have occupied us, and set their new borders.」
 
 st00_c09
 v00an0977
 アンジ「What evidence have you?」
 v07to0431
 トニー「All that I need. The report of the spy which I sent makes it clear.」
 The two bowed their heads at the same time. After a pause, Princess Christina was the first one to raise her head again and break the silence.
 
 st00_c08
 v00an0978
 アンジ「...Then, I shall ask you one question.」
 v07to0432
 トニー「Anything.」
 st00_c07
 v00an0979
 アンジ「If your words are true, what shall become of this kingdom?」
 v07to0433
 トニー「...Regretfully, that is the decision of the other two kingdoms.」
 st00_c08
 v00an0980
 アンジ「What about my people?」
 v07to0434
 トニー「As long as there is no resistance, there will be minimal damage. The two kingdoms shall not engage in meaningless conflict and thus soil their reputation with the other kingdom.」
 
 st00_c06
 v00an0981
 アンジ「...And my retainers?」
 v07to0435
 トニー「...The same.」
 st00_c02
 v00an0982
 アンジ「So, you are saying... that we shall surrender without a fight?」
 v07to0436
 トニー「No. If that were to happen, you shall be in danger, Milady.」
 st00_c09

 v07to0437
 トニー「Is that what you truly believe?」
 st00_c08
 v00an0984
 アンジ「......」
 Ein took a step forward towards the princess, who remained silent.
 v07to0438
 トニー「―Be it Red or Blue, their desire is the Doll Arts of our kingdom.」
 v07to0439
 トニー「And foremost among the people who hold that ability is you, Milady, the ruler of the White Kingdom― Christina Dorn.」
 
 v07to0440
 トニー「...Even if you choose a peaceful solution, Milady, your future shall not be bright.」
 
 v07to0441
 トニー「Are you willing to accept that future as your fate, and resign yourself to being a prisoner until the day you die?」
 
 st00_c03
 v00an0985
 アンジ「...If that is truly my fate...」
 v07to0442
 トニー「Do you truly not mind that your future shall not include the Schwester?」
 st00_cxx

 アンジ「...From the Schwester...」
 v07to0443
 トニー「―If you wish for a future with the Schwester, Milady...」

 アンジ「Silence!」

 v07to0445
 トニー「No big deal. A failure of an actor like me, that's the only thing I'm good at.」
 Even though I said that flippantly, actually, my heart was pounding with nervousness from the fear of messing up.
 Still, our practice had gone well, not just because I was good at memorizing my lines...
 
 But because my partner was Angelina, an outstanding actor.
 
 st00_c08
 v00an0990
 アンジ「...So how was my acting?」
 v07to0446
 トニー「You were like the princess herself.」
 st00_c06
 v00an0991
 アンジ「...You're not flattering me, are you?」
 v07to0447
 トニー「Yeah. If I flattered just every girl like that, I'd get the cold shoulder from her for sure.」
 
 st00_c01
 v00an0992
 アンジ「...Ahahaha, you mean Silvia would get jealous?」
 v07to0448
 トニー「Who knows? That's a difficult question to answer.」
 Just like that, the conversation shifted to what Silvia thinks about me.
 Was I like a lover to her... or was I just convenient to have around?
 st00_c00
 v00an0993
 アンジ「I think you're both quite compatible, you know?」
 v07to0449
 トニー「Why, thank you. But in my eyes, the two of you are much more compatible, aren't you?」
 
 st00_c12
 v00an0994
 アンジ「O-of course not, we're not really―」
 v07to0450
 トニー「...Seeing you two interact on stage, it really looks that way to me.」
 st00_c05
 v00an0995
 アンジ「Eh?」
 v07to0451
 トニー「Hm?
 I'm talking about when you practice together as the Princess and the Schwester.」
 I couldn't help but smirk at Angelina's nervous face.
 So even she, who always remains composed even if you teased her, is unable to hide how she feels when someone mentions the name ‘Belle.’
 
 st00_c10
 v00an0996
 アンジ「...It's weird when you change the subject like that.」
 v07to0452
 トニー「You're the one who changed it first.」
 That's right, you shouldn't tease grown-ups.
  By the way, it's an old maxim that revenge should be threefold.
 v07to0453
 トニー「Milady, there is a question I wish to ask of you.」
 st00_c06
 v00an0997
 アンジ「...You may speak.」
 Adapting to the situation quickly like this was one of her strong points.
  To match me, she had transformed into the Princess flawlessly.
 v07to0454
 トニー「What would you do, Milady, if Lady Angelina and Belle's futures do not include each other?」
 
 st00_c08
 v00an0998
 アンジ「...That is...」
 Is that nervous look of hers an act? Or how she truly feels?
  ...Whichever it was, it was an interesting expression.
 v07to0455
 トニー「(―If I tease her too much now, things will get messy for me.)」
 Looks like I'd better stop while I can, and simply laugh this situation away―
 
 st00_c07
 v00an0999
 アンジ「It is foolish to even consider that kind of future... if that truly happens, even if we are apart―」
 
 st00_c00
 v00an1000
 アンジ「My heart shall always be with the Schwester.」
 v07to0456
 トニー「(―That line isn't bad.)」
 Maybe I'll quietly pass it along to Wakaba later.
 v07to0457
 トニー「And you shall always be inside Belle's heart as well... you're gonna say that, right? How fiery.」
 
 st00_c09
 v00an1001
 アンジ「T-that's not what I mean. I was speaking as Christina just now, you got the question wrong, so I fixed it with my ad-lib.」
 
 ...What a flimsy excuse. She must have worked pretty hard to make that up.
  Alright, I've taken my revenge.
 v07to0458
 トニー「...By the way, Angelina,」
 I shifted the conversation topic once more as if nothing had happened.
 v07to0459
 トニー「You were born in the Blue Capital, right?」
 I had overheard that from a conversation Cero and the others once had.
  It was about Angelina being raised in an orphanage.
 st00_cxx
 v00an1002
 アンジ「...That's right, why do you ask?」
 v07to0460
 トニー「I lived in the Blue Capital long ago too, and haven't been back in quite a while... so I wanted to ask you what it's like recently.」
 
 st00_c00
 v00an1003
 アンジ「How long have you not been back there?」
 v07to0461
 トニー「...Let me think, well, about...」
 I'd lost count of the years that had passed.
  I still remembered my address, though the last time I wrote back was―
 v07to0462
 トニー「―I forgot.」
 st00_c08
 v00an1004
 アンジ「...I see. Is your family still in the Blue Capital?」
 v07to0463
 トニー「Well, who knows about that. Maybe, I guess...」
 I'm sure Mom is still doing well, surrounded by a bunch of kids and―

 How could you just disappear without even leaving a note!」
 Oh no!
 face06_a02

 If Silvia heard what we were whispering to each other, she'd probably kill me.

 Today was my private practice session with Angelina.
 Since I was pissed at Tonino for practicing behind my back, I asked Angelina to tutor me privately as payback―
 
 v06si0684
 シルヴ「Princess, please be careful.」
 st00_c02
 v00an1082
 アンジ「...That's wrong, Silvia. The line is ‘careful, please.’」
 v06si0685
 シルヴ「Eh―, really?」
 Still, the practice was quite strict once we started.
 I referred to the script notes I'd written on my palm for this scene, and looked for the part I'd gotten wrong.
 
 v06si0686
 シルヴ「...Ah, it's true!
 Amazing, you can even catch other people's mistakes.」
 
 Unbelievable.
 v06si0687
 シルヴ「How did you know?
 It's a lot of trouble for me just trying to remember my own lines. Could it be that you've memorized everyone's lines?」
 
 That idiot Tonino also memorizes each and every word of the script perfectly, but are there real actors like that, too? 
 
 st00_c04
 v00an1083
 アンジ「I'm able to get a grasp of things overall, but the details are impossible for me.」
 v06si0688
 シルヴ「Eh, but isn't the mistake you just pointed out a detail?」
 st00_c00
 v00an1084
 アンジ「That was because it's a line from a conversation with me, so I could remember it. Isn't that natural?」
 
 v06si0689
 シルヴ「That's impossible for me. I've been trying so hard, and all I can manage is ‘this line comes after this person's...’」
 
 I said that as if I'd been working myself to death, but was I exaggerating too much?
 
 st00_cxx
 v00an1085
 アンジ「Even if you say that, your acting skills are pretty passable.」
 v06si0690
 シルヴ「Hmm, maybe it's because I can remember them with my body rather than my head or something?」
 I wasn't used to people praising me.
 When I was a child, I always thought of it as fake flattery, so that became a habit and I couldn't accept honest praise.
 
 v06si0691
 シルヴ「...I've never really been good at learning things.」
 st00_c00
 v00an1086
 アンジ「But you worked hard to learn how to become a doll engineer, didn't you?」
 v06si0692
 シルヴ「Eh―?
 That's because doll engineering is an intuitive kind of skill, it's more about your body than your head.」
 
 Though my mentor is the type that was pretty lacking in that sense.
 v06si0693
 シルヴ「Of course, you need some knowledge too, but that can be learned naturally along the way. Since it's necessary, you can naturally remember it, something like that.」
 
 v06si0694
 シルヴ「I'm sure you've felt the same. If you know that it will benefit your acting, you don't feel that stressed out when you study something, right?」
 
 st00_c06
 v00an1087
 アンジ「...I guess.」
 Even though she'd agreed with me, it seemed like she had something else on her mind.
 After a while,
 st00_c02
 v00an1088
 アンジ「Hey, let's say I wanted to become a doll engineer... do you think I have that kind of potential?」
 
  she asked.
 v06si0695
 シルヴ「―Well, you won't know before you try. Though all you need is just passion for it...」
 
 ―Still.
 v06si0696
 シルヴ「Honestly, I don't recommend it to you.」
 st00_c05
 v00an1089
 アンジ「Why?」
 v06si0697
 シルヴ「...If you were gonna become an engineer, it must be for Sister Belle's sake, right?」
 
 st00_c03
 v00an1090
 アンジ「W-well, that's...」
 Her transparent reaction brought a sad smile to my lips.
 v06si0698
 シルヴ「If that's the case, I don't think you could become an engineer even if you learned the skills.」
 st00_c08
 v00an1091
 アンジ「...That might be so.」
 We were talking about the devotion of a person's whole life here, so I had to be careful what to reply to her.
 
 If she'd try to juggle being both an actress and a doll engineer just because of a momentary impulse, I have to be strict with her even if it wasn't entirely honest.
 
 v06si0699
 シルヴ「Listen, Angelina.
 There's a saying that each person has their own role.」
 
 I borrowed the line Cero had used when he took Tonino away in the Red Capital.
 
 v06si0700
 シルヴ「...And your role now is Princess Christina. That is also your responsibility. It would be difficult for the others to search for a replacement for you, right?」
 
 As I saw her nodding wordlessly, I felt relieved.
 v06si0701
 シルヴ「―That applies to your life too. You must be firm on your goal to become an actress.」
 v06si0702
 シルヴ「Besides, Sister Belle is in her father's good hands right now.」
 v06si0703
 シルヴ「...And if there's an emergency, there's always the new generation of doll engineers, right?」
 
 How's that?
 What I said just now is just begging for her to shoot me down.
 st00_c04
 v00an1092
 アンジ「...You're right. In that case, I'll leave it to you.」
 v06si0704
 シルヴ「W-wait!
 Don't approve of me so easily, at least act a little suspicious!」
 
 Why is she looking straight at me like that!?
 st00_c00
 v00an1093
 アンジ「...Oh, what's wrong?
 Are you embarrassed?」
 v06si0705
 シルヴ「......O-of course not!
 What I meant to say was, don't believe in other people so easily.」
 
 st00_c06
 v00an1094
 アンジ「Would I be wrong to trust you?」
 Aaah, I can't take this anymore.
  She keeps staring at me with that serious face, her expression not changing one bit.
 v06si0706
 シルヴ「...Okay, fine. I guess you can.」
 st00_c01
 v00an1095
 アンジ「Ufufufu.」
 v06si0707
 シルヴ「...Geez!
 You're getting more and more like Sister Belle recently.」
 These innocent types are the most difficult sort of people for me to deal with.
 st00_c00
 v00an1096
 アンジ「Alright, let's get back to our practice.」
 I gestured in agreement, as I thought of what would happen in the future.
 
 black450
 I'm sure we'll be forging a closer relationship with her and the others, perhaps for quite some time.
 
 ―But that might not be a bad thing after all.
 sr050
 I raised my hand and asked,
 v06si0708
 シルヴ「Ah, before that, I have something I want to ask... can I?」
 I peered closely at Angelina's face.
 It bore a resemblance to a person I knew quite well.
 
 
 v06si0709
 シルヴ「This has nothing to do with what we were talking about, but if I remember correctly, you were raised in the Blue Capital... in an orphanage, right?」
 
 st00_cxx
 v00an1097
 アンジ「That's right.」
 Quite something, that this girl is actually... that person's sister.
 black450
 st07_a03
 v07to0468
 トニー「...Of course I know.」
 st07_a06
 v07to0469
 トニー「But you know, Silvia. It's difficult to say it after all this while.」
 In the past, Tonino had told me how he had left the Blue Capital, and when I tried to ask about Angelina, he answered that vaguely.
 
 He didn't admit it clearly, nor did he deny it.
 Then I asked him if he expected a reunion when Angelina's family come to see her perform.
 
 st07_a03
 v07to0470
 トニー「Well, that's if she's able to recognize me on stage...」
 
 v06si0710
 シルヴ「...Hey, are you inviting your family to come to the theater festival?」
 st00_c04
 v00an1098
 アンジ「...Yeah. If they can, I'd like everyone to come and watch.」
 v06si0711
 シルヴ「I see, that's great!
 That's really great!」
 st07_a01
 v07to0471
 トニー「...Well, I definitely won't be able to spot them anyway.」
 st07_a00
 v07to0472
 トニー「...Since it's like the audience is in another world.」
 st07_a04
 v07to0473
 トニー「The lights on stage are too bright, so you can't see anyone over in the seats.」
 Even though Tonino ended our conversation there, acting cool like always, in my opinion―
 
 black450
 bg20a01
 st00_c00
 st00_c05
 v00an1099
 アンジ「But why ask that all of a sudden?」
 v06si0712
 シルヴ「Ah, no, it's nothing, don't worry about it. I just felt like asking.」
 st00_c02
 v00an1100
 アンジ「...That really makes me worried.」
 v06si0713
 シルヴ「Come on!
 You want to let your beloved family watch their child shine on stage, right?」
 
 st00_c12
 v00an1101
 アンジ「Y-yup.」
 v06si0714
 シルヴ「Come come, Princess. For the sake of not failing that task, we must practice.」
 st00_c00
 v00an1102
 アンジ「...That ‘come come’ just now is a little much.」
 v06si0715
 シルヴ「...Well, isn't our Princess picky about the minor details...」
 If Tonino were to spend some time together with Angelina―
 ...I felt that he might be able to pull himself together and become a more responsible man.

 It's been a long time since I've set foot in this courtyard, but things have hardly changed.
 
 
 v27ha0002
 ハンス「―Two years, huh.」
 Two years ago was the day I set off for the Blue Kingdom, to exercise my linguistic talents in the position of ambassador.

 han_d01
 Since then, I had devoted myself entirely to my duties, and not come home even once.
 han_d05
 But I soon realized, after not even three months had passed, that I was already growing weary of the job.
 My task was to handle all communication directed to the White Kingdom and approve all the related paperwork.
 Other duties included acting as Weiss' representative and making courtesy calls on holidays.
 
 
 
 It was not a job that required much of any skill. Most of it was ornamentation on matters that were, in essence, terribly dull.
 I could recognize that it was undeniably an important role.
 But even so...
 han_d03
 v27ha0003
 ハンス「Performing those tasks, day in and day out, was truly dreadful.」
 I had begun to entertain the thought, ‘Perhaps I should resign?’
 But amidst that drudgery, someone came who could save me.

 ハンス「―Thanks to him, my work became much more fulfilling.」
 I could not be more grateful to him.
 And the one thing I could do to repay his kindness is to return to Weiss.

 The premises of Dornstein Castle were remarkably silent.
 I understand that Princess Christina keeps the minimum number of servants and guards by her side, but isn't this a little too insecure?
 
 For a moment, I thought I had come to the castle at the wrong time―
 v27ha0006
 ハンス「There's no way that could be true.」
 As I closed my timepiece, I caught sight of a person waving at me from the window of the second floor.
 
 v27ha0007
 ハンス「(―Is that... a child?)」
 No.
 The person's height was that of a child, but the peculiar breadth of their head made them instantly recognizable.

 ハンス「Oh, that's Lord Jussi!」
 Awash with nostalgia after having seen that figure, I entered the castle's interior.

 I was quite amazed that Lord Jussi had arrived before me.

 Could it be that time really does change people?

 I stood in front of the guest room, straightened my collar, than opened the door and bowed deeply to the one inside.

 ユッシ「Don't you think we should have a military prepared to deal with any emergency?!」

 Steam rose from Lord Jussi's brow as his nose twitched in frustration. He glared straight at me as he gave his fervent speech.

 - He revealed the name of his bitter enemy.

 Wasn't he just criticizing Ein over our military being inadequate?

 jus_b07
 v28ju0044
 ユッシ「What!?」
 v27ha0039
 ハンス「N-nothing.」
 \p\wI wanted to say that the Princess's bodyguard possesses supreme swordsmanship, as well as the demeanor of a noble... but I had best hold my tongue.
 
 To begin with, Dua was born to a noble family, the Carlstedts.
 v27ha0040
 ハンス「(―In other words, if Dua were a man, he would have no complaints.)」
 jus_b01

 v27ha0041

 Dua is considered to be the finest swordsman in our country.
 On the contrary, I don't think five ordinary guards could best Dua's incredible prowess.
 
 v28ju0047
 ユッシ「Well, forget about that girl who can't do anything but wave her sword around. The main problem is Ein.」
 
 And now he's back to talking about his arch-enemy. I wish he could see things from my perspective.
 
 From Lord Jussi's perspective, Ein is the spear being twisted in his side.

 ユッシ「Unlike I, who always stood steadfast for what I believed in.」
 v27ha0051
 ハンス「...Yes, I suppose you follow your own principles.」
 How much he's willing to put at stake for them is an entirely different matter.
 At present, there isn't really a single person who can oppose the supremacy of the Princess's steward - Ein.
 
 v28ju0057
 ユッシ「Indeed, indeed! My point is, what do those guys who stare at papers all day know about running a country?」

 Something doesn't make sense.
  Just now, it sounded more like he was hoping he could return to his original position...

 If we wish to bring to fruition this plan of ours, our trust of each other is of the essence.
 
 I, myself, trust Lord Jussi.

 That is a matter entirely different from trust.

 I had thought Lord Jussi was one who could operate without risk of retribution.
 
 It would be best were we able to use his authority to quash any suspicions that arose.
 But unfortunately, within Weiss, that is no longer applicable.
 
 
 Due to that... we are left only with more underhanded methods.

 black450
 SE14a
 A long time ago.
 
 Within the mines of the Red Kingdom, a great quantity of gemstone had been extracted, and a certain someone discovered it to have a special power.
 
 It was in fact quite the accident.
 When he was toying with a pendant made of the gemstone, he had accidentally dropped it.
 \p\wIt had landed upon a doll, and the doll had begun to move a tiny bit. That was how it happened.
 At first, the animate dolls that were being created were simple things made of wood and cloth and served as children's toys.
 
 But, drawn by the stone's mysterious properties, adults became interested as well as children.
 
 After many long years, more of these gemstones were discovered with different powers... and the Red Kingdom devoted itself to researching them.
 
 Eventually, they were able to create dolls that resembled humans.
 
 
 bg57a01
 v28ju0090
 ユッシ「Hoho, so you've been studying about dolls.」
 v27ha0079
 ハンス「Yes. Since it has everything to do with our White Kingdom.」
 black450
 Their popularity was spurred on by human curiosity, and soon enough, news of the dolls spread to countries near and far.
 
 Naturally, the Red Kingdom demonstrated its new art to the Blue Kingdom and many nobles grew interested.
  
 
 
 Soon the agriculture to which the Red Kingdom had devoted its vast lands was replaced by a mining economy.
 
 
 
 In turn, the Blue Kingdom with its overseas trade connections prospered by exporting the goods produced.
 
  
 
 That was how the two kingdoms' business relationship was established. Through the trading of ‘dolls,’ it developed at an impressive pace.

 jus_b04

 v27ha0081
 ハンス「Hahaha, that is true.」
 The kingdom of Weiss is located upon the border of the two kingdoms, and was established to serve as a symbol of peace between the two kingdoms.
 
 Rather than remain but a symbol, the White Kingdom quickly became an important center for the research of dolls.
 
 v28ju0092
 ユッシ「Particularly our Princess Christina, the master tuner. She is probably one of the finest that has existed in history.」
 
 v27ha0082
 ハンス「That is the privilege of the royal blood- the house of Dorn.」
 For generations upon generations, our royalty had conducted research on dolls. In turn, they shared most of their discoveries with the Red and Blue Kingdoms.
 
 But amidst these breakthroughs, there were a few that were named the ‘Secret Recipes.’
 These Secret Recipes are shared only among the descendents of the house of Dorn. You can say that they were the single defining characteristic of our royalty.
 v27ha0083

 Perhaps due to the novelty of life in the castle coupled with her homesickness, whether day or night, she frequently lost her composure and burst into tears.

 Along with the news was an addendum which wrote, ‘Coco ought to know of this already.’

 From her words, I determined that Coco was unable to comprehend what the death of a person really meant.
 
 When our country's engineers were called in to inspect her, they discovered some astounding things.
 
 Beneath that adorable-looking exterior was a structure and craftsmanship the like of which had never been seen before - a completely new application of doll arts.
 
 If we were to dismantle Coco, whose design we know nothing about, our chances of reconstructing her would be slim.
 
 
 For that reason, I instead employed my specialty, ‘tuning’, upon Coco's body.
 
 However, the tuning process took up a lot of my time, and so practice for the play was stalled as a result.
 
 After some consideration, I decided to seal the part of Coco's memory relating to her grandmother temporarily―

 The first scene is ‘The Angel's Egg,’ played by Coco, arriving at the castle.
 The queen was looking forward to her meeting with the Angel's Egg.
 She waited and waited, but the Angel's Egg did not arrive, so she wandered around the castle in worry, trying to find her.
 v21cr0052
 クリス「Very well, then. Let us start.」
 Slightly nervous myself, I recited the first lines.
 v21cr0053
 クリス「―I heard that she had arrived, but where in the world could she be?」

 v02co0361

 v21cr0055

 v02co0362
 ココ「Yes, yes.」
 v21cr0056
 クリス「...At this point you will respond with ‘Who is it?,’ so please do so.」
 v02co0363
 ココ「So up to this point I, must stay put, is that, right?」
 v21cr0057
 クリス「Yes. You will be hiding behind a pillar at this time. Stay hidden even as you reply.」
 
 coc_a03
 v02co0364
 ココ「I got it―!」
 v21cr0058
 クリス「All right, then. Let us try practicing all of that together.」
 I looked for something that could serve as a pillar for Coco to hide behind.
 v21cr0059
 クリス「Coco, could you please hide behind those bushes?」
 coc_a02
 v02co0365
 ココ「So that I won't be found?」
 v21cr0060
 クリス「That's right.」
 v02co0366
 ココ「Kay―, I'll go hide.」

 Coco trotted happily to the bushes I pointed at.

 v22ef0130

 v21cr0062
 クリス「(―Ah, so it was hide and seek.)」
 When I was still young, me, my father and our retainers would―
 bg52b01
 v02co0370
 ココ「Princess, do you know, about it―?」
 v21cr0063
 クリス「...Yes.」
 \nWhat nostalgic memories.
 When it was our retainers' turn to hide, they would always go easy on me, and purposely stick their head or feet out for me to spot.
 
 v21cr0064
 クリス「(―But as for Father, he would...)」
 v21cr0065
 クリス「Hehe.」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0131
 エファ「―Your Highness?」
 v21cr0066
 クリス「I'm sorry. I just remembered something amusing.」

 Only Father would hide so well that I could never find him at all. And just as I was on the verge of tears, he would come flying out for me.
 
 v02co0371
 ココ「Princess―, I'm hidden―.」
 v21cr0067
 クリス「Okay, then we are ready to begin.」
 v02co0372
 ココ「R―e―, a―, d―y―」
 After laughing slightly, I calmed myself, drew in a deep breath of air and―
 
 v21cr0068
 クリス「―I heard that she had arrived, but where in the world could she be?」
 \nI recited the first line again.
 v02co0373
 ココ「I am here―!」
 v21cr0069
 クリス「(―Oh, my. What an energetic reply.)」
 v22ef0132
 エファ「...Coco. It's not time to respond to the Princess yet.」
 v02co0374
 ココ「Awawa―! That's right―!」
 As I glanced over at where Coco's voice came from, I could somewhat see her frantically trying to cover her own mouth.
 
 bg52b01
 v21cr0070
 クリス「All right then, one more time. Are you ready, Coco?」
 v02co0375
 ココ「......」
 v21cr0071
 クリス「(―I suppose her lack of reply means she's taken Efa's words to heart?)」
 v21cr0072
 クリス「Ahem... I heard that she had arrived, but where in the world could she be?」
 v02co0376
 ココ「......」
 v21cr0073
 クリス「(―You're doing well, Coco)」
 I pretended to look for Coco here and there, while continuing my act.
 v21cr0074
 クリス「And so, the queen finally arrived at the hall.」
 At this point would be Coco's first words.
 v21cr0075
 クリス「Oh, Angel's Egg, where could you be?」
 v02co0377
 ココ「...」
 v21cr0076
 クリス「Oh, Angel's Egg, where could you be?」
 v02co0378
 ココ「......」
 v21cr0077
 クリス「(―Looks like she's forgotten the timing of her own appearance.)」
 v02co0379
 ココ「......」
 v21cr0078
 クリス「―Efa, I have a request of you.」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0133
 エファ「Certainly.」
 v21cr0079
 クリス「Please go to where Coco is and tell her that she should respond now.」
 v22ef0134
 エファ「I understand.」
 bg52b01
 Efa quietly approached the bushes where Coco was hiding, crouched behind her and tapped her on her back.
 
 coc_g03
 v02co0380
 ココ「U, waah―! I've been found―!」
 v22ef0135
 エファ「Coco, it's your turn now. The princess is waiting.」
 coc_a04
 v02co0381
 ココ「W, whawa? Is that so?」
 
 v22ef0136
 エファ「Quickly give her a reply. ...Okay?」
 coc_g01
 v02co0382
 ココ「Awawa. Kay― I am here! Over here―! Princess―!」
 v21cr0080
 クリス「Ufufufu.」
 \nCoco's head was covered in leaves.
 v21cr0081
 クリス「You've appeared just a little bit too late.」
 I walked towards them, and looked up at the sky.
 bg52b01
 v21cr0082
 クリス「(―I suppose there is still plenty of time.)」
 v21cr0083
 クリス「Well then, why don't we try something different?」
 v02co0383
 ココ「Something different?」
 v21cr0084
 クリス「Yes. Coco's favorite game, hide and seek. The three of us will play.」
 coc_a03
 v02co0384
 ココ「Hide and seek―!」
 v21cr0085
 クリス「Efa, you said you don't know hide and seek, right?」
 v22ef0137
 エファ「Y-yes.」
 v21cr0086
 クリス「―Coco. Will you explain the rules to Efa?」
 coc_g03
 v02co0385
 ココ「Kay―!」
 She started explaining as if her life depended on it.
 v02co0386
 ココ「Um, well, um, well...」
 Her exaggerated gestures as she spoke were truly amusing.
 bg52b01
 v21cr0087
 クリス「You two shall be hiding first. I will be the one who searches for you.」
 Taking care not to dirty my dress as I went under the shade of the tree, I waited for them to finish hiding.

 ユッシ「Ah, so that's what it is...」
 Though Lord Jussi was staring out the window, he appeared completely uninterested. He let out a sigh.
 
 v27ha0101

 jus_b01
 v28ju0110
 ユッシ「Hmph, if you are talking about guards, there's one over there.」
 v27ha0102
 ハンス「Eh?」
 The person Lord Jussi pointed to was no doubt the figure of Dua, captain of the guards.
 She was known to keep a close watch upon Her Highness at all times, her movements covert to avoid attention.
 
 v27ha0103
 ハンス「...Quite observant of you, Lord Jussi.」

 ユッシ「―Heh, that Dua. Just keeping an eye on them during that game must test the limits of her meager ability.」
 
 v27ha0105

 Up here in our room, it is not difficult to survey the courtyard. But for Dua, I could not imagine that she would be able to keep track of all of their movements.

 I had become lost in thought for a moment and fallen behind in my conversation with Lord Jussi.

 He clenched his fists and slammed them down onto the table, in a display of uncontrollable anger.

 ...As proof of his agitation, he grimaced in pain. It seems the gesture was enough to hurt his hands.

 v28ju0119

 v27ha0110
 ハンス「Y-yes... more or less.」
 As he merely sought affirmation of his own opinion, I agreed with him without thinking, though guilt arise in me soon after.
 
 I'm sure Lord Jussi believes that a relationship formed through economic exchange will never weaken... but he is forgetting that humans grow jaded over time.

 \nSimply put, this is all Lord Jussi's fantasy again.
 v27ha0114
 ハンス「(―No, I cannot be sure of that.)」
 On the other hand, even though Jussi has no evidence for his accusations, it's quite possible that Lord Ein censured Lord Jussi's dealings for a purpose of his own.
 
 If I were Lord Ein, I would definitely not leave Lord Jussi to do as he wishes.

 If he goes on one of his tantrums during a critical part of our operation, we would be in trouble. I should let him release that anger right now, while we can afford it.

 The man I've been waiting for has arrived!
 v27ha0119
 ハンス「Well, well, if it isn't Lord Valery. We have been waiting for you.」
 
 This man is Valery, the Blue Kingdom's newly appointed ambassador, here to attend the memorial ceremony.
 
  
 
 During my time as an ambassador to the Blue Kingdom, I had met Valery, who had proposed his fine plan to me.
  
 
 
 
 v28ju0135
 ユッシ「So this man is Valery?!」
 
 Though it was their first meeting, Lord Jussi was already glaring up at Valery.
 
 While Lord Valery, who towered over Lord Jussi, had to bend his head downwards to meet his eyes.
 
 v26va0005
 ヴァレ「Well, well, a pleasure to meet you. My name is Valery Jacquard. I am honored to make your acquaintance.」
 
 
 He bowed his head respectfully.
 
 
 ...But there was no such respect in the fierce gazes locked upon each other.
 
 Faced with such tension between the two, I volunteered myself as mediator...
 v27ha0120
 ハンス「Lord Valery, this is Lord Jussi.」
 v26va0006
 ヴァレ「―Again, a pleasure to meet you, Jussi. I have heard quite a bit about you.」
 v28ju0136
 ユッシ「A-aren't you late! Where have you been dawdling about―」
 
 Displeased by the fact that the man was towering over him, Lord Jussi stepped back a few paces so their gazes could meet more comfortably.
 \p\wThen he resumed his self-assured stance.
 
 v27ha0121
 ハンス「(―Ah, if I don't think of something quick...!)」
 Just as I worried that, Valery shot me a glance and raised a hand as if to signal that the next move was mine to make.
 
 v27ha0122
 ハンス「Lord Valery and Lord Jussi. Why don't we take a seat for now?」
 \p\wI bid them sit while fetching a chair for our guest, Lord Valery.
 v26va0007
 ヴァレ「A fine idea. Come, Lord Jussi, please have a seat.」
 Jussi ignored his proposal.
 v28ju0137
 ユッシ「...Are you treating me like I'm an old man?」
 v26va0008
 ヴァレ「I would not dare.」
 As Valery said that, he shook his head slowly, his expression as if Lord Jussi's words had amused him.
 
 v28ju0138
 ユッシ「Ugh...」
 That flamboyant manner was serving to aggravate Jussi all the more...
 v27ha0123
 ハンス「(―If this goes on, we won't be able to talk.)」
 v27ha0124
 ハンス「Um, Lord Valery...」
 v26va0009
 ヴァレ「...However, I must say that this castle is supremely well built.」
 v28ju0139
 ユッシ「Hm?」
 v26va0010
 ヴァレ「Earlier, I was standing outside the door, but I could clearly identify who was inside the room.」
 v27ha0125
 ハンス「(―What!?)」
 v26va0011
 ヴァレ「I did not even have to worry that I might have the wrong room.」
 v28ju0140
 ユッシ「What are you trying to say? There are no windows on the door―,」
 
 \p\wbegan Lord Jussi, his posture showing that he was convinced that he was right and Valery was the one being ridiculous.
 
 v26va0012
 ヴァレ「If someone passed us by, even if they couldn't overhear our exact words, were they to stop and focus on eavesdropping, they might gather enough from tone of voice alone.」
 
 v26va0013
 ヴァレ「―What I'm saying is, could we be a little bit more careful?」
 v27ha0126
 ハンス「M-my apologies.」
 v28ju0141
 ユッシ「Ughhh, I suppose you are right in some sense...」
 Lord Jussi had no rebuttal, but neither could he let the insult slide.
 v28ju0142
 ユッシ「―H, however, if you had arrived on time we wouldn't have had to say all those needless things earlier.」
 
 v26va0014
 ヴァレ「Oh, for that, you have my sincere apologies.」
 v26va0015
 ヴァレ「―Because it was my first time visiting, the guards asked me numerous questions and would not let me in until they had confirmed my identity.」
 
 v27ha0127
 ハンス「My deepest apologies. I should have had been there to sort out the confusion.」
 v28ju0143
 ユッシ「...Quite true. I also shall say a word of apology on Hans' behalf for his clumsiness.」
 Though it was certainly my mistake, there was no need for Lord Jussi to apologize in my stead.
 
 v28ju0144
 ユッシ「He will not make such an error again, so do forgive him.」
 v26va0016
 ヴァレ「Fear not. I have no intent of demanding compensation or anything of the sort.」
 I wanted to speak, but I held myself back.
 ...Lord Jussi is just this kind of person.
 Seeing that Lord Jussi is being provoked by a man with such an overbearing attitude, it's understandable that his behavior is erratic.
 
 I must remain open-minded―
 v28ju0145
 ユッシ「By the way. What was that matter concerning wine?」
 v26va0017
 ヴァレ「―Wine?」
 v28ju0146
 ユッシ「That's right! I heard from Hans that wine was going to be involved somehow, or rather...」
 
 v26va0018
 ヴァレ「...」
 v28ju0147
 ユッシ「Is this wine a necessary item in our upcoming plan?」
 As he spoke, Jussi raised his silver cup.
  Everything he is saying resulted from his own misunderstanding.
 v28ju0148
 ユッシ「Hm? Or could it be that you have brought a gift from Blew, such as a bottle of... wine?」
 
  
 
 
 And so Jussi continued pursuing the topic of the ‘wine’ keyword.
 
 v27ha0128
 ハンス「(―I suppose it is only natural for him to be doing this.)」
 Amongst our plan, there was absolutely no written explanation for the code word ‘wine.’
 v26va0019
 ヴァレ「The bottle has already arrived, and you've still no idea?」
 v28ju0149
 ユッシ「What do you mean? I know nothing of this.」
 
 v26va0020
 ヴァレ「And I thought you had already taken a look around...」
 v28ju0150
 ユッシ「W-what are you talking about? If it's this wine, it's produced in Weiss...」
 
 Lord Jussi's face clearly showed his ignorance of what Lord Valery meant.
 And then... he went restlessly searching across the room for clues. Beholding that sight, I felt sorry for him.
 v27ha0129
 ハンス「(―My apologies, Lord Jussi.)」
 Lord Valery was not willing to divulge even a single hint, though I felt it would be better if he would share at least a little more information.
 v27ha0130
 ハンス「(―Well then, I guess I'll...)」
 As a little revenge upon Lord Jussi, I'll tease him with a small hint.
 
 
 v27ha0131
 ハンス「That's right. Speaking of which, not long ago we were looking down upon the courtyard together, weren't we?」
 
 v28ju0151
 ユッシ「...Courtyard, you say!?」
 His gazed moved to the courtyard before whirling back to me and Valery, his temper incited by our elusive words.
 
 v28ju0152
 ユッシ「Stop being so stingy. Will you hurry up and tell me the meaning of this wine!」
 v26va0021
 ヴァレ「―Do not rush me. I've traveled a long way, and am tired from my journey. So give me time to arrange my thoughts―」
 
 v28ju0153
 ユッシ「What are you saying? Didn't you arrive a whole day ago?! How could you be tired?」
 
 
 v26va0022
 ヴァレ「After being appointed as the new ambassador, I had to introduce myself to those I shall be working with... I have hardly had time for a break.」
 
 v28ju0154
 ユッシ「Grrr...」
 v26va0023
 ヴァレ「...Though I am considerably busy, I still mustn't disregard important businesses such as this. Well, then―」
 
 
 
 With a smooth gesture, Valery fixed his collar.
 v26va0024

 \nAnd so he did.

 ヴァレ「As Lord Hans mentioned, that land is directly on the border the two kingdoms. So the problem arises... to whom does that valuable land belong?」
 
 v26va0043
 ヴァレ「...Tension is building in a most worrisome fashion in the area near the border, as each nation claimed fervently that the mineral deposit belonged to their own country.」
 
 v26va0044
 ヴァレ「Next, the Red Kingdom hinted that they will have to increase the price of their exports, since their resources are no longer as abundant as before.」
 
 v28ju0164
 ユッシ「Hmmmm.」
 v27ha0134
 ハンス「―Is that so?」
 This conversation was one I had not heard even during my time in the Blue Kingdom, thus I was interested.
  
 
 v26va0045
 ヴァレ「And as the Red Kingdom continued to lay claim on the mineral deposit―」
 v26va0046
 ヴァレ「If the Red Kingdom could secure this source of minerals, prices would stabilize. The Red Kingdom could make a deal with the Blue Kingdom and all would be well... but.」
 
  
 
 v28ju0165
 ユッシ「...Hoho.」
 v26va0047
 ヴァレ「The world would be a better place if it functioned on such logic, but such an ideal world does not exist.」
 v26va0048
 ヴァレ「They could, for example, declare that the vein was bogus and thus raise the price on mineral exports anyway.」
 
 v27ha0135
 ハンス「(―I see.)」
 v27ha0136
 ハンス「Or perhaps, Lord Valery. Even if it turns out to be true that the production on minerals has decreased―」
 v27ha0137
 ハンス「―They very well could claim the expenses of excavating the vein must also be reflected in a higher price for the minerals, isn't that right?」
 
 v26va0049
 ヴァレ「That is correct.」
 v28ju0166
 ユッシ「Hm? Hmmm...」
 v26va0050
 ヴァレ「―Have you understood everything up until now?」
 v28ju0167
 ユッシ「O-of course I understand everything! But what does all that have to do with our White Kingdom?」
 
 
 
 v26va0051
 ヴァレ「That is not the full story. Please hear me out.」
 v28ju0168
 ユッシ「There's more?」
 v26va0052
 ヴァレ「Yes. Will you listen?」
 v28ju0169
 ユッシ「Just quickly get on with it! Summarize it as briefly as possible.」
 
 v26va0053
 ヴァレ「In regards to the lower output of minerals, that report alone is considerably suspicious.」
 
 v28ju0170
 ユッシ「Hm?」
 v26va0054
 ヴァレ「My opinion is that the production of minerals has not decreased. They are merely using that as an excuse to reap additional profits.」
 
 v28ju0171
 ユッシ「How sly of them...」
 v26va0055
 ヴァレ「Yes, I agree fully. In this trade exchange where Blew buys and Cardinal sells, Blew will suffer loss while Cardinal gains profit.」
 
 
 
 
 v26va0056
 ヴァレ「And hence the Red Kingdom will become more and more powerful while the Blue Kingdom declines.」
 v28ju0172
 ユッシ「That's an outrageous conclusion!」
 v26va0057
 ヴァレ「That is why, in order to avoid such a fate befalling Blue Kingdom, I beseech the two of you to lend me your aid.」
  
 
 
 He reached out as to offer a handshake, his expression composed and cheerful.
 ev902a
 v28ju0173
 ユッシ「...Hey, Valery.」
 v26va0058
 ヴァレ「Yes, what is it?」
 v28ju0174
 ユッシ「I understand the situation that the Red and Blue Kingdoms are faced with- the dispute of recognition over their mutual claim to the vein.」
 
 v28ju0175
 ユッシ「But what has that got to do with us? If we also made a claim to the minerals, then it would be obvious. But right now, how is this relevant?」
 
 v26va0059
 ヴァレ「...Lord Jussi, I would like you to think about it on a more grand scale.」
 
 
 
 v28ju0176
 ユッシ「What did you say?」
 v26va0060
 ヴァレ「If the balance between the Blue and Red Kingdom were to collapse, it would surely have repercussions for the White Kingdom―」
 v28ju0177
 ユッシ「...All right, I get it! Regarding this entire topic, I'll just ask Hans to explain it to me later.」
 
 
 As his countryman, seeing Jussi clench his teeth in frustration made me feel most embarrassed too.
 
 v28ju0178
 ユッシ「The thing I want to know about the most is this ‘wine,’ you got it!?」
 v28ju0179
 ユッシ「Isn't it about time you should answer my question? After beating around the bush for so darn long!」
 
 v27ha0138
 ハンス「...L-Lord Jussi, you might want to lower your voice. If not―」
 
 v28ju0180
 ユッシ「Argh, stop whining, you're annoying!」
 Reaching the limit of his temper, he raised his hands to slam the table, but then Valery casually stepped forward.
 
 
 
 black450
 Lord Valery slid his hand inside his justaucorps, and then―
 v28ju0181
 ユッシ「Ugh!?」
 ef004a
 ef004ax
 SE30c
 black450
 His arm shot out, aiming at Lord Jussi.
 v28ju0182
 ユッシ「Ugh... y-you... b-bastard...!?」
 \p\wIn a flash, Valery's silver comb had passed a hair's breadth from the throat of the noble from which those vulgar words emerged.
 v26va0061
 ヴァレ「Oops, my apologies.」
 Lord Valery withdrew his silver comb with a grandiloquent gesture, thrust it into his hair, then smiled thinly.
 
 ev902a
 v26va0062
 ヴァレ「Oh, so what were we talking about just now? Ah, now I remember, of course. You wanted to talk about ‘wine.’」
 
 
 v28ju0183
 ユッシ「......T-that's right. About ‘wine’.」
 Lord Jussi settled down and adjusted his collar.
 Before I knew it, I was doing the same as well.
 v26va0063
 ヴァレ「Wine, wine, wine. It is but one word, but it can mean many things.」
 
 v26va0064b
 ヴァレ「...Whether or not it is a famous vintage, as long as the wine has been properly aged, it would mysteriously become fine.」
 
 
 
 v26va0065
 ヴァレ「―But...」
 v28ju0184
 ユッシ「Hm?」
 v27ha0139
 ハンス「Lord Valery?」
 In the midst of his explanation, the speaker stopped and gazed at the door.
 Then he begun speaking again.
 v26va0066
 ヴァレ「―Lord Jussi, who is knowledgeable in the field of gastronomy, is surely more learned than I in this.」
 
 \p\wIt seemed we were beginning to approach the matter at hand.
 v28ju0185
 ユッシ「...Well, that's only natural! I have traveled far to your kingdom to taste wines from all over the world.」
 
 
 v26va0067
 ヴァレ「What if I said that I have an exquisite vintage that not even you have heard of before?」
 
 
 v28ju0186
 ユッシ「Oh? Then what is this exquisite vintage you speak of?」
 v26va0068
 ヴァレ「Well, a better way to put it is... you know of this vintage, but you have not realized its presence.」
 
 v28ju0187
 ユッシ「Hm? What is the name?」
 
 v26va0069
 ヴァレ「...Please come closer.」
 v28ju0188
 ユッシ「What now?」
 Valery beckoned Jussi over, then quietly whispered the name of the secret vintage into his ears.
 
 v26va0070
 ヴァレ「The name of the vintage is... Christina Dorn.」
 v28ju0189
 ユッシ「W-what? T-that's our princess...」
 v26va0071
 ヴァレ「Shhh, you are being too loud.」
 Valery kept one eye closed as he placed his finger on his lips, signaling for a softer conversation, then laughed.
 
 v26va0072
 ヴァレ「Well, so you see, the name of that vintage should never depart from our mouths. It must be kept a secret.」
 v26va0073
 ヴァレ「I, myself, wish to take that wine back to the Blue Kingdom.」
  
 
 v28ju0190
 ユッシ「W-what in the, back to your kingdom...」
 v26va0074
 ヴァレ「Of course, I do not intend to savor the wine all by myself.」
 v26va0075
 ヴァレ「I shall present you with gifts that of value equivalent to that wine.」
 
 v28ju0191
 ユッシ「Valery... the very fact you are doing such a thing means...」
 v26va0076
 ヴァレ「Even my kingdom has numerous wine experts... but let's set that aside for the time being...」
 Valery straightened up and walked briskly around the table, towards the wall.
 
 And then,
 v26va0077
 ヴァレ「I just remembered something very important.」
 
  Casually, he reached out for the door and opened it―

 Upon the threshold stood Dua, completely silent.
 v26va0078
 ヴァレ「I was about to call out for you so you needn't knock. Lady Dua.」
 
 v27ha0141
 ハンス「(Did Valery knew that Dua was out there?)」
 Indeed, she was Dua, the personal bodyguard of our princess― But what is she doing here!?

 Several seconds after there was a knock upon the door,
 v25du0074
 デュア「―Lord Ein. Are you in there?」
 Dua's well-mannered voice entered my ears.
 v24ei0110
 アイン「Come in, it's not locked.」
 There are only a few people who would come to visit me in my office at such an early hour.
 v24ei0111
 アイン「(―The Lady, Dua...)」
 v24ei0112
 アイン「...Or Coco.」
 Just remembering that little guest of ours brought a faint smile to my face.
 v25du0075
 デュア「―Sorry to disturb you.」
 dua_b01
 Conscientious as always, she made sure to shut the door behind her before approaching my desk, and then bowed courteously.
 
 I've told Dua countless times that she doesn't need to be so formal, but she's stubborn.
 
 v24ei0113
 アイン「You're here early as usual. So, what's the hurry?」
 v25du0076
 デュア「No, it's not a particularly urgent matter― but I would like to remind you that the meeting to prepare the budget is today.」
 
 
 
 v24ei0114
 アイン「Ah. I see.」
 In order to govern this kingdom, there's a great deal of paperwork that needs to be done.
 I must take particular care to properly document its finances.
 v24ei0115
 アイン「(―Looks like more paperwork is coming.)」
 Generations ago, each minister would read their budgetary requests during this meeting and, if there were no objections, they'd be approved.
 
 However, as I see it, the resurrection of this ancient practice only weakens the symbolism of making these entreaties directly to the sovereign instead.
 
 v24ei0116
 アイン「...This is all such nonsense.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0077
 デュア「Huh?」
 v24ei0117
 アイン「The existence of the preparatory meeting, I mean.」
 dua_b05
 v25du0078
 デュア「...I'll keep that in mind...」
 Finding it difficult to voice her opinion before me, she averted her eyes and muttered something.
 
 dua_b01
 It seemed she had something on her mind, but I did not feel the need to go out of my way to inquire about it.
 
 v24ei0118
 アイン「(―Regarding the documents they shall submit...)」
 \p\wInvariably, those pages are packed with useless platitudes that exist only to make a fine speech, burying the truth in dubious agendas.
 With not a shred of credibility to them, they were worse than blank sheets of paper.
 
 
 Such are the grand accomplishment of the meetings we have when it comes time to draft a budget, when the ministers make their reports and examine those of their peers.
 
 At that time, the ministers are asked to defend any questionable or unclear aspects of their report. If they cannot do so, their budget requests will be refused.
 
 v24ei0119
 アイン「Strictly speaking, the preparatory meetings are a complete waste of time.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0079
 デュア「But Lord Ein, if you abolished the preparatory meeting, it's likely that someone like Lord Jussi would misunderstand and raise an outcry...」
 
 v24ei0120
 アイン「...I know.」
 I must prevent people of that sort from increasing in number.
 
 dua_b05
 v25du0080
 デュア「I apologize for being so impertinent with my opinion.」
 v24ei0121
 アイン「No, you are quite right. Let's leave things as they are.」
 \p\wIf possible, I'd prefer to deal with the record holder for wasting the most time during preparatory meetings as little as possible.
 
 
 v24ei0122
 アイン「―By the way, what business have you with me today?」
 dua_b01
 v25du0081
 デュア「...Yes. It is in regards to the proposal I made the day before yesterday to increase the number of imperial guards. May I inquire about your decision?」
 
 
 
 v24ei0123
 アイン「...」
 I expected I would be pressed for an answer soon, but I didn't think it would be the first thing in the morning.
 v24ei0124
 アイン「Once again, you're quick to demand an answer today.」
 I shuffled through my desk and drawers in search of the relevant documents.
 
 dua_b05
 v25du0082a
 デュア「...You don't have to give an answer right now, but I'm aware you often put off these sorts of tasks.」
 
 dua_b01
 v25du0082b
 デュア「―I am simply reminding you to make your decision, that is all.」
 ...Hmm, where did I put it again...
 v24ei0125
 アイン「So you're saying you have always been able to read me like a book, eh?」
 dua_b04
 v25du0083
 デュア「As I am the captain of the guard, if I return without an answer every single time, my competence will be suspect.」
 
 Dua replied with a sigh and a tired expression.
 I had been thinking that she'd become more gentle than she used to be, but some of her old bluntness still remains.
 dua_b01
 v25du0084
 デュア「By the way, I notice you seem to have been looking for something...」
 v24ei0126
 アイン「Is that so?」
 Her face didn't contain a single trace of sarcasm as she asked that. I wonder how she would react if she knew I was looking for the document she's been asking for―
 
 With that as my motivation, I went through the entire stack, flipping through it page by page, but found nothing.
 
 v24ei0127
 アイン「―Regarding those documents, may I deliver my answer to you later?」
 dua_b04
 v25du0085
 デュア「How long will it take?」
 v24ei0128
 アイン「I shall definitely have them for you some time today.」
 dua_b01
 v25du0086
 デュア「I understand.」
 Judging by her expression, she may have already figured out my problem.
 
 So I closed the drawer, took a deep breath, and stared at the captain of the guard standing before me.
 
 dua_b06
 v25du0087
 デュア「...Is there something on my face?」
 v24ei0129
 アイン「Nope. Nothing at all.」
 dua_b01
 v25du0088
 デュア「...?」
 Nothing was the matter, but I did not care to have her question me further, so I tried to steer the conversation to less serious affairs.
 
 v24ei0130
 アイン「By the way, about those two girls, Efa and Coco. What are they doing?」
 v25du0089
 デュア「I've told them to stay put until the preparatory meeting has finished.」
 v24ei0131
 アイン「So that's why.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0090
 デュア「What do you mean?」
 v24ei0132
 アイン「I was wondering why Coco wasn't here yet, even though it's around the time she usually comes to play.」
 
 v25du0091
 デュア「Coco? She comes here?」
 
 v24ei0133
 アイン「That's right. Yesterday we played hide and seek, and Coco hid behind that door over there.」
 She had thought she was well hidden, but her wind-up key was showing.
 
 v25du0092
 デュア「If she is interrupting your work, I can entertain Coco in your stead...」
 v24ei0134
 アイン「No, that won't be necessary. In fact, it makes a perfect break.」
 
 dua_b05
 v25du0093
 デュア「...If that is what you wish, Lord Ein.」
 v24ei0135
 アイン「Hm? Is there some problem with it?」
 dua_b06
 v25du0094
 デュア「―No. I am just not used to them yet.」
 v24ei0136
 アイン「You are speaking of Efa and Coco?」
 dua_b05
 v25du0095
 デュア「―Yes.」
 Coco from the Blue Kingdom and Efa from the Red Kingdom.
 They were summoned here to perform in the play ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings,’ as part of our memorial ceremony.
 
 But as we are a small kingdom, it is not an overreaction to be cautious of those two dolls.
 
 
 
 dua_b01
 v25du0096
 デュア「I do not want to suspect them, but as the Princess's bodyguard, I must be prepared when...」
 
 v24ei0137
 アイン「You mean ‘if,’ right?」
 v25du0097
 デュア「Yes... am I thinking too much?」
 v24ei0138
 アイン「No, not at all. You're speaking as a person whose duty it is to protect the Princess, so you're right.」
 dua_b05
 v25du0098
 デュア「...」
 v24ei0139
 アイン「Hm? Are you not happy even though I said you are right?」
 
 v25du0099
 デュア「No, it is not that. It is just that I am having difficulty sorting out my emotions.」
 
 v24ei0140
 アイン「You're trying to say that your personal feelings are at odds with your professional duties, correct?」
 dua_b01
 v25du0100
 デュア「―Yes. Especially regarding Coco...」
 v24ei0141
 アイン「―Say no more. I understand.」
 I could not express it in words, but Coco has a mysterious charm that draws people to her.
 v24ei0142
 アイン「(―It would be fitting to say that she is an ‘existence blessed by God's love.’)」
 When one speaks to Coco, it's impossible to be suspicious of her.
 
 v24ei0143
 アイン「...Still, don't let your guard down.」
 v24ei0144
 アイン「We must be prepared for anything, no matter how unlikely.」
 dua_b05
 v25du0101
 デュア「...Yes.」
 Still, there is a problem regarding the relationship between the Lady and the dolls that Dua doesn't know about yet.
 
 v24ei0145
 アイン「I wish to confirm something. Have there been any problems with Coco and Efa recently?」
 dua_b01
 v25du0102
 デュア「None at all.」
 v24ei0146
 アイン「I see. Remain on guard.」
 v25du0103
 デュア「Yes.」
 \nDua nodded, her response immediate.
 v24ei0147
 アイン「―Well then. I have paperwork to finish...」
 dua_b04
 v25du0104
 デュア「Lord Ein.」
 v24ei0148
 アイン「What is it? Is there something else?」
 
 dua_b01
 v25du0105
 デュア「...Actually, there is one small problem...」
 Her words more circumspect than usual, Dua glanced towards the door.
 
 v24ei0149
 アイン「(―She's worried that someone may be outside the door, eh...?)」
 v24ei0150
 アイン「Is there something else you need to report to me?」
 dua_b05
 v25du0106
 デュア「Yes.」
 v24ei0151
 アイン「Then, tell me now, since there's no one around.」
 I composed myself and waited for her report.
 dua_b01
 Dua cleared her throat, then took one step forward.
 v25du0107
 デュア「It was a few days ago. Coco and the Princess were practicing for the play, when I spotted some suspicious people watching them from the guest room.」
 
 
 v25du0108
 デュア「...I immediately realized it was Lord Jussi, and next to him, Lord Hans.」
 
 v25du0109
 デュア「Perhaps they were just interested in the rehearsal, but I cannot shake the feeling that it may be something more.」
 
 v25du0110
 デュア「At the same time, I'd just received notice from the messenger that an ambassador from the Blue Kingdom had arrived and was seeking permission to enter the castle.」
 
 
 v24ei0152
 アイン「That would be the new ambassador, Lord Valery, right?」
 v25du0111
 デュア「Yes.」
 black450
 Last night I had passed by a statesman's horse-drawn wagon near the castle gates.
 
 
 I had been headed for the castle, while that wagon was leaving.
 bg_val
 I had spotted someone within, but only long enough to exchange a brief nod. I think that person was Lord Valery.
 bg58a01
 v24ei0153
 アイン「I've heard he's a sharp and able fellow.」
 dua_b03
 v25du0112
 デュア「...Sharp fellow? He's a dirty crook!」
 
 Her tone of voice changed drastically in the middle of her sentence.
 From the sound of it, something must have happened to make her so angry.
 v24ei0154
 アイン「Please continue.」
 dua_b05
 v25du0113
 デュア「―Yes. Apparently the reason for his sudden visit was that he had an appointment with Lord Jussi.」
 
 v24ei0155
 アイン「So that's why Lord Jussi was in the guest room.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0114
 デュア「...I too thought that, and it seemed logical, so I gave permission to let him pass, but―」
 
 v25du0115
 デュア「I couldn't stop worrying, so I decided to head to the guest room myself, and directed one of my subordinates to watch over the Princess.」
 
 It was so like her to think and act that way.
 v25du0116
 デュア「Standing at the door, I heard people quarreling inside. So I wondered if I should knock...」
 
 dua_b05
 v25du0117
 デュア「While I was still thinking about what to do, Valery opened the door and invited me in.」
 
 v24ei0157
 アイン「You were noticed, eh?」
 v25du0118
 デュア「...Yes.」
 v24ei0158
 アイン「Hmm. He's quite something if he can sense even your presence.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0119
 デュア「What do you mean by that?」
 v24ei0159
 アイン「I mean exactly what I just said.」
 dua_b05
 A few days ago, while I was chatting with Coco, Dua had suddenly appeared without me having noticed her approach.
 
 She is the Princess's bodyguard, so I suppose she's used to keeping a low profile.
 
 v24ei0160
 アイン「Never mind. Please continue.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0120
 デュア「―At first, I was surprised that Valery knew my name.」
 
 v24ei0161
 アイン「...So, he addressed you by name.」
 v25du0121
 デュア「Yes. He was a man I'd never met before, and yet he called me by my name before anything else.」
 
 v24ei0162
 アイン「―And then he said ‘As an ambassador, of course I would remember the names of Princess Christina's closest guards,’ right?」
 
 dua_b06
 v25du0122
 デュア「...」
 \nDua looked at me with wide eyes, surprised.
 v24ei0163
 アイン「What is it?」
 v25du0123
 デュア「N-nothing, it's just... what you just said was exactly right, Lord Ein.」
 v24ei0164
 アイン「Oh, is that so.」
 It was just random conjecture, but it seemed to have been on the mark. I smiled thinly in response.
 
 v24ei0165
 アイン「...Well? How did the people inside react to you?」
 dua_b04
 v25du0124
 デュア「―Lord Valery was calm and composed. The other two, however, seemed quite shaken.」
 
 v25du0125
 デュア「Lord Jussi immediately assured me that he was the one who invited these guests, and encouraged me to leave.」
 
 v25du0126
 デュア「―Hans seemed nervous, exchanged a formal greeting with me and started making small talk in a shrill tone.」
 
 v24ei0166
 アイン「They're quite a transparent lot.」
 Their reactions indicated that they were participating in some sort of confidential conversation.
 
 dua_b05
 v25du0127
 デュア「My arrival had probably come as quite a surprise to them.」
 Judging from Lord Jussi's and Hans' reactions, as well as the presence of the new ambassador, one could not help but think they were plotting something in the shadows.
 
 v24ei0167
 アイン「What happened afterwards?」
 dua_b04
 v25du0128
 デュア「I was about to excuse myself and depart, when Valery asked me if I would like some wine.」
 
 v25du0129
 デュア「I politely declined, and so he requested that I keep their discussion a secret.」
 
 v24ei0168
 アイン「Secret?」
 v25du0130
 デュア「...That's right. I refused the wine, and in return he asked me not to tell you about this.」
 
 v24ei0169
 アイン「And yet, here you are...」
 dua_b05
 v25du0131
 デュア「Yes.」
 v24ei0170
 アイン「Is that all right? Breaking your promise with the Blue Kingdom's ambassador?」
 
 dua_b04
 v25du0132
 デュア「I have not broken any promises. I told Lord Valery that it was useless to try and stop me from reporting. Despite that, he brushed aside my words and carried on talking.」
 
 
 Dua's personality is impressively straightforward.
 But she ought to be more careful of her words, in case they do more harm than good.
 Depending on the situation, there are times when you must leave your thoughts and feelings unsaid.
 v24ei0171
 アイン「―Well then, Lord Valery must have been taking into account that you would report anything you heard to me, so what did he say after that?」
 
 If he had meant for their conversation to be overheard, then there's no harm in listening to it.
 
 v25du0133
 デュア「From what I could gather, the three of them were talking about wine.」
 v24ei0172
 アイン「Wine?」
 v25du0134
 デュア「It was a wine that Lord Valery greatly admired, and he said he wanted to take it back to his own kingdom.」
 
 v24ei0173
 アイン「That doesn't seem to be anything that needs to be kept secret...」
 dua_b05
 v25du0135
 デュア「...They were saying it was a brand of wine prohibited from leaving the country, and they argued over what to do with it.」
 
 v24ei0174
 アイン「Oh?」
 v25du0136
 デュア「Lord Valery also said, ‘If this conversation reaches Lord Ein, whom I have not even met yet, his opinion of me shall suffer.’」
 
 
 
 v25du0137
 デュア「Then, when I asked him why he had let me hear all that, as if he wanted me to...」
 
 dua_b04
 v25du0138
 デュア「―He replied, ‘Well, that's because I thought you'd already heard plenty while you were standing outside’...!」
 v24ei0175
 アイン「He's a pretty cautious man. Lord Valery, that is.」
 It's hard to believe he was going so far just to bring home some wine he was fond of.
 
 For normal citizens, that would be smuggling, but someone with the rank of an ambassador would be above such laws.
 
 v25du0139
 デュア「...Also, he told me ‘If you could put in a word so that I could bring this wine past the border, I'd reward you generously.’ The cheek of it!」
 
 v24ei0176
 アイン「Did you decline his offer?」
 dua_b03
 v25du0140
 デュア「Of course! Do I look like the sort of person who takes bribes!?」
 
 
 v24ei0177
 アイン「No.」
 dua_b04
 v25du0141
 デュア「Please, Lord Ein, do not trifle with me like that...! Anyway, as soon as I refused, he leered at me and―」
 
 v24ei0178
 アイン「What did he say?」
 dua_b03
 v25du0142
 デュア「―That man casually told me ‘I could introduce you to some fine young noble blood. Which do you prefer? Men? Or perhaps women?’!」
 
 v25du0143
 デュア「On top of that, he even said I'd be given plenty of time so I could inspect them to my heart's content!」

 Shoulders trembling, she clenched her fist and was about to slam it down on my desk...
 
 but regained control of herself at the last second.
 dua_b05
 v25du0144
 デュア「...I-I humbly apologize.」
 \nShe calmed herself and took a step back.
 v24ei0179
 アイン「The fault is mine. I seem to have dredged up an unpleasant memory for you.」
 
 v25du0145
 デュア「...No, I should have put my feelings aside and given a more objective report of the situation. For that, I apologize.」
 
 I understood it was hard for Dua, but I could not console her.
 Adopting a professional attitude with her and assuring her I would carry out my duties faithfully was the most I could do.
 v24ei0180
 アイン「―Dua. This situation... do you think there's more to it than meets the eye?」
 dua_b04
 v25du0146
 デュア「Yes, I do. What about you, Lord Ein?」
 v24ei0181
 アイン「At least concerning this ‘wine’ that they're trying to sneak out of the kingdom.」
 Had it actually been the illegal export of some wine they were discussing, it would not be difficult for someone like Valery, since he is an ambassador.
 
 
 
 Which means there's something more to it, and they've established this facade to cover up their real intentions.
 
 v24ei0182
 アイン「Did Lord Jussi or Hans say anything?」
 v25du0147
 デュア「They said little while I was there. They left all the talking to Valery, all they did was nod and agree with him.」
 
 v24ei0183
 アイン「Before Lord Valery began speaking to you, did he communicate with the two in some way?」
 v25du0148
 デュア「...Yes. He turned his eyes to them, and they both nodded.」
 v24ei0184
 アイン「―I see.」
 In other words, he signaled for them not to say anything unnecessary.
 Though I have not even met Lord Valery yet, I could already tell that he was undoubtedly a man I must not take lightly.
 
 v24ei0185
 アイン「(―Or rather...)」
 \nI have a gut feeling that he's definitely an enemy of this kingdom.
 v24ei0186
 アイン「So then, what shall we do about this?」
 v25du0149
 デュア「―If you wish, I can offer them my cooperation and investigate further...」
 v24ei0187
 アイン「No. They're already wary of you, no doubt. You're not suited to the role of a spy.」
 v25du0150
 デュア「Then, is there someone else who...」
 v24ei0188
 アイン「―Indeed. Let us find someone from outside the castle.」
 dua_b06
 v25du0151
 デュア「Outside of the castle?」
 v24ei0189
 アイン「As the two of us live within the castle, there are things we cannot see.」
 
 
 
 I can only think of three people who would be suited for this task.
 One of them has been a servant in the Osborne household for many years.
 It's best to strike at the opponent with the weakest defenses, therefore we will begin by investigating Lord Jussi.
 
 
 v24ei0190
 アイン「I will dispatch a messenger and make the preparations immediately. The rest I shall leave in your hands, are we clear?」
 
 dua_b01
 v25du0152
 デュア「Understood.」
 To this day, I have overcome the attacks of many political opponents.
 \p\wHowever, this time, we are faced with a foreign ambassador to whom our country has granted hospitality.
 Since he possesses a certain degree of immunity, we must exercise extreme caution in our investigation.
 
 
  I don't enjoy being so forceful, but it was something that had to be said.
 v24ei0191
 アイン「One more thing. None of this shall be divulged to the Lady.」
 v25du0153
 デュア「―I shall keep that in mind.」

 エファ「―Your Highness. It seems it may rain tomorrow.」
 As I was finishing Efa's tuning, she suddenly spoke up.
 K_BGM08
 v21cr0089
 クリス「Eh?」
 Before I knew it, I had responded oddly.
 efa_a01
 v22ef0139
 エファ「Um. Somehow, I think it will.」
 v21cr0090
 クリス「―I see.」
 The process of tuning, performed to balance a doll's mind, can sometimes produce unexpected results.
 
 black450
 In the past, there was a doll I tuned who reacted in a similar manner - she too made these kinds of unusual predictions.
 
 v21cr0091
 クリス「(―Giselle...)」
 I was awash in nostalgia at the thought, though my memories of her were dim. Once I tried comparing the two, I realized she had little in common with Efa.
 
 
 
 bg60a01
 v21cr0092
 クリス「...Well then, the tuning is done now. You may relax.」
 v22ef0140
 エファ「Yes, Your Highness.」
 My mood lifting as well, I placed my hands on Efa's shoulders and turned her around.
 I slowly embraced her, stroking her hair as our faces drew close to one another.
 
 v21cr0093
 クリス「You may open your eyes now.」
 
 
 efa_a04
 v22ef0141
 エファ「...Yes.」
 She opened her eyes as if waking from a deep sleep, then met my gaze with a nod of affirmation.
 v21cr0094
 クリス「How are you feeling?」
 If she is well, then I should call for Coco next, as she's waiting outside in the hallway.
 
 efa_a01
 v22ef0142
 エファ「Yes, I feel a bit light-headed... but I think I will be all right.」
 v21cr0095
 クリス「Ah, you may remain seated for a while longer.」
 v22ef0143
 エファ「But...」
 v21cr0096
 クリス「Careful, it's dangerous.」
 Efa staggered as she rose to her feet. I lent her my hand, and guided her back to her seat.
 
 v21cr0097
 クリス「It would be most upsetting if harm befell you.」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0144
 エファ「Yes.」
 \nEfa nodded meekly, quietly hanging her head.
 Actions like that demonstrated how smooth her movements were. She is quite possibly the most natural-looking doll I have ever met.
 
 v21cr0098
 クリス「(―No wonder they call her the ‘Pride of the Red Kingdom.’)」
 Efa has existed for much longer than I have.
 She was originally created to serve as a rehearsal partner for plays, and was subsequently educated to serve that purpose.
 
 black450
 ...They then realized that she had much more potential than they had ever imagined.
 
 She memorized entire scripts from just one reading. She was famous for being able to reproduce movements exactly as instructed.
 
 Not only that, she even had the ability to perform impromptu without prior rehearsal.
 Ever since the day they had discovered her beautifully humming a complete etude, they had arranged her debut on stage.
 
 \p\wA certain member of the Red Kingdom's royalty was impressed enough by her performance to put her on the list of national treasures.

 efa_a04
 v22ef0145
 エファ「Um. Your Highness.」
 v21cr0099
 クリス「What is the matter?」
 v22ef0146
 エファ「During the tuning... did you find anything about me to be odd?」
 v21cr0100
 クリス「Please be at ease. There is nothing amiss with your body.」
 v22ef0147
 エファ「I see.」
 v21cr0101
 クリス「Is there something else worrying you?」
 v22ef0148
 エファ「...Yes.」
 Efa was created in such a way that she can never lie when questioned.
 
 v22ef0149
 エファ「There is something I do not understand.」
 v22ef0150
 エファ「―Your Highness. For what reason did you invite me to the Dornstein Castle?」
 
 v21cr0102
 クリス「Efa, could the same thing that happened to Coco have...」
 It appears I have failed the tuning process once again―
 v22ef0151
 エファ「No, I am fine. I am here to perform in the memorial ceremony that will be held.」
 
 v21cr0103
 クリス「...Please, do not startle me like that.」
 K_BGM08
 v22ef0152
 エファ「I'm sorry.」
 v21cr0104
 クリス「But if you know the answer... why did you say it is something you do not understand?」
 
 v22ef0153
 エファ「It is as I said.」
  Efa's expression did not change. She looked straight at me, her eyes harboring not a hint of deceit.
 
 
 
 v22ef0154
 エファ「I am a doll that was created to perform in plays.」
 v22ef0155
 エファ「Yet in spite of that, since coming here, you have treated me as a guest and not an actress―」
 
 v21cr0105
 クリス「―Please forgive me, Efa.」
 Theatre is the most important thing to Efa.
 I'm sure she is anxious that she's not fulfilling her duties as a representative of the Red Kingdom.
 
 
 v21cr0106
 クリス「It is my incompetence in not setting time apart for our rehearsals that is at fault...」
 
 efa_a05
 v22ef0156
 エファ「Y-Your Highness? Please, don't bow your head like that.」
 
 Efa crouched down to gaze into my eyes.
 v22ef0157
 エファ「It is but a misunderstanding. There is no need for you to apologize, Your Highness.」
 From her expression, I could tell that my reaction had upset her.
 v21cr0107
 クリス「...Then...」
 v22ef0158
 エファ「Please accept my utmost apologies. My words were the cause of this misunderstanding. The thing that I do not understand is not related to theater.」
 
 v21cr0108
 クリス「It isn't?」
 v22ef0159
 エファ「Yes. ...So, would you be so kind as to hear me out until the end?」
 v21cr0109
 クリス「I understand... but, I have one request.」
 v22ef0160
 エファ「W-what is it?」
 v21cr0110
 クリス「Please do not humble yourself so much. Just talk normally.」
 
 
 v21cr0111
 クリス「Say what you think. Do not choose your words with me, but speak to me as you would a member of your family.」
 Since she has been staying with us for a while now, I feel she has the right to speak more freely.
 Those words of hers, ‘Please accept my utmost apologies’, were chosen due to the gravity of her role as a representative of the Red Kingdom. How pitiable.
 
 v21cr0112
 クリス「(―I wouldn't mind if she just said ‘I'm sorry...’)」
 v21cr0113
 クリス「At the very least, please speak normally when the two of us are alone.」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0161
 エファ「Y-yes. ...But, Your Highness, it's natural for a person such as me to show you―」
 v21cr0114
 クリス「―Efa. I shall not allow you to say anything more than that.」
 efa_a05
 I lightly pressed my finger to her lips.
 v21cr0115
 クリス「You are... a far more precious being than you believe yourself.」
 v21cr0116
 クリス「Right now, you are an honored guest from the Red Kingdom. Your talent and charm has earned you our esteem.」
 
 
 
 v21cr0117
 クリス「Though we have only been together for a short time, I have still managed to gain some understanding of how high your value is.」
 
 v22ef0162
 エファ「Your Highness...」
 v21cr0118
 クリス「Please do not speak of ‘a person like me’ as if that were something vulgar and inferior.」
 
 
 v21cr0119
 クリス「You imply that I, who recognized you as precious, have judged you wrongly.」
 
 
 efa_a04
 v22ef0163
 エファ「...I am most terribly sorry.」
 v21cr0120
 クリス「Is that not what I am speaking of? I told you not to be so formal.」
 
 
 v21cr0121
 クリス「―If you merely answer ‘Yes,’ that is quite enough.」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0164
 エファ「Yes.」
 When Efa agreed obediently, I felt relieved.
 I would like to avoid forcing other people to use words they're not comfortable with.
 
 v21cr0122
 クリス「As long as you understand, that is well. Forgive me for speaking so forcefully.」
 
 efa_a04
 v22ef0165
 エファ「...Not at all, Your Highness. Please do not apologize to me. If you apologized, I wouldn't know what to do...」
 v21cr0123
 クリス「Ah, I did not notice. Please forgive...」
 Realizing I had already failed to heed her request, I broke out a laugh.
 v21cr0124
 クリス「...Ufufu. It seems that we are both set in our ways...」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0166
 エファ「You're right.」
 \nSomehow, Efa found it in her to laugh.
 v21cr0125
 クリス「(―Yes, this is how it should be.)」
 My desire was for a more casual and easy-going relationship.
 In a public setting, I can understand the need for formal speech. But when it's just the two of us, I'd like to be able to spend our time together more leisurely.
 
 v21cr0126
 クリス「...Now then, what were we speaking of before?」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0167
 エファ「Eh? Umm...」
 
 Efa and I both went silent, as we tried to recall the original subject of our conversation.
 
 efa_a01
 v22ef0168
 エファ「...I remember. It began when I said ‘I don't understand.’」
 v21cr0127
 クリス「So it did. You were saying...」
 The pressure had lifted from my chest, but the original problem still remains.
 v22ef0169
 エファ「What I meant to say was that I don't know what I should do.」
 v21cr0128
 クリス「What you should do?」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0170
 エファ「Yes.」
 \nEfa lowered her gaze, her eyes lonesome.
 K_BGM05
 v22ef0171
 エファ「I am a doll. I understand full well the purpose of my own existence, that I must do as I'm told.」
 
 v22ef0172
 エファ「But, I can only be a doll on the stage.」
 v22ef0173
 エファ「When it comes to daily activities such as greeting someone or bidding them farewell, I know not a thing, and am always at a loss for what to do.」
 
 
 v21cr0129
 クリス「Efa...」
 Her words of confession were so unexpected, I became speechless.
 
 v21cr0130
 クリス「(―I never thought she was troubled by such a simple matter...)」
 v22ef0174
 エファ「Your Highness, do you remember the day that Coco lost her memories and we found her sitting in the hallway?」
 v21cr0131
 クリス「―Yes of course.」
 That was a result of a mistake in my tuning. There's no way I could forget it.
 v22ef0175
 エファ「You then had some business to attend to and left, so it was just Coco and I.」
 v22ef0176
 エファ「At the time, Coco asked me a variety of questions that... I hardly knew how to answer.」
 
 v22ef0177
 エファ「The only questions I was able to answer properly were those related to dolls.」
 v22ef0178
 エファ「When she asked my favorite food, I could only say that I liked tasty food―」
 
 v22ef0179
 エファ「When she asked my favorite flower, I could only say lilies, as it's one of the few I've seen inside books.」
 
 v22ef0180
 エファ「I was taught never to lie, so I have no choice but to somehow find an answer to questions using the meager amount of knowledge I have.」
 
 v22ef0181
 エファ「Nor could I decide whether that was the proper response. All I could do was simply answer without thinking.」
 
 v22ef0182
 エファ「It's not that I cannot lie, it's just that I don't know how to― I am just an ignorant doll who knows nothing of the world.」
 
 ...I remained silent, listening quietly until Efa finished her tale.
 
 bg60a01
 And then, seeing Efa stop and bow her head, I placed my hand on her shoulder.
 
 v21cr0132
 クリス「―So you had a chat with Coco, is that so?」
 v22ef0183
 エファ「Yes.」
 v21cr0133
 クリス「And what did you think of her back then?」
 v22ef0184
 エファ「...」
 Since Efa looked unsure how to answer, I gave her a hint.
 
 v21cr0134
 クリス「...Were you feeling envious of her?」
 v22ef0185
 エファ「...Yes.」
 v21cr0135
 クリス「Then that means we are the same, Efa.」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0186
 エファ「―Eh?」
 v21cr0136
 クリス「When I spoke to Coco, I too felt envious of her.」
 v22ef0187
 エファ「You as well, Your Highness?」
 v21cr0137
 クリス「Yes. And you can probably guess what I was envious of without me telling you.」
 
 Coco can always express her feelings without worry. She says what she wants to say and everything she does, she does with all her spirit.
 
 Since Coco was raised and educated like an ordinary child, she knows how to express herself freely with her body language, even when words fail her.
 
 v21cr0138
 クリス「Efa. What kind of life did you lead in the Red Kingdom?」
 
 
 efa_a04
 v22ef0188
 エファ「I was... normally asleep inside a showcase.」
 v21cr0139
 クリス「―I see. So that is how it was after all...」
 When I performed the tuning on Efa, I noticed the gems inside of her reacted sluggishly, and a portion of them were even misaligned.
 
 These are symptoms of long periods of hibernation and then, conversely, equally long periods of activity and toil.
 
 v21cr0140
 クリス「So you were only awoken when they wished you to perform?」
 v22ef0189
 エファ「Yes.」
 I can understand why they would want to preserve her durability, seeing as how she is the treasure of the kingdom.
 
 However, that kind of attitude is not for the benefit of the doll. Rather, it is to serve human greed, which I cannot approve of.
 
 v21cr0141
 クリス「If you go back to your kingdom, will they make you go to sleep again?」
 v22ef0190
 エファ「Yes... they will.」
 It was a fate that she did not even question.
 If I could do anything for her, I would like to change that fate of hers a little.
 v21cr0142
 クリス「Do you have any dreams? For example...」
 
 v22ef0191
 エファ「When I am asleep, my dreams only reflect my own loneliness.」
 v21cr0143
 クリス「(―Ah. That's not what I meant...)」
 What I meant to ask was whether she had any hope for the future, like hopeful dreams.
 Rising to the challenge, I inquired about a different topic.
 v21cr0144
 クリス「Have you gotten used to living here in Weiss?」
 
 
 \nI asked, and then―
 v22ef0192
 エファ「...No, I have not.」
 Again, her reply was unexpected, and I was thrown off balance.
 If this goes on, the conversation will never grow any less dismal.
 v21cr0145
 クリス「Why is that? Is there something you dislike―」
 
 v22ef0193
 エファ「No.」
 v21cr0146
 クリス「Then is it the food that is not to your liking? Or the climate―」
 
 efa_a05
 v22ef0194
 エファ「You are mistaken, Your Highness. It's that... this might seem like a product of my own selfishness―」
 v21cr0147
 クリス「Please go ahead and say it. If it is within my power to change, I will do so to the best of my ability.」
 
 efa_a04
 v22ef0195
 エファ「...」
 \nEfa remained silent for a while.
 ...And then, she eventually gave in and said.
 v22ef0196
 エファ「It is Dua and Ein... It feels as if they are always glaring at me,」
 
  she added.
 v21cr0148
 クリス「Glaring at you?」
 v22ef0197
 エファ「...Yes. Rather than accusing them of glaring, perhaps I should say it is the manner in which they treat me.」
 
 v21cr0149
 クリス「(―Their manner in which they treat her...)」
 v22ef0198
 エファ「I feel that they do not trust me at all...」
 v21cr0150
 クリス「...Is that so.」
 I, myself, understand the reason they behave that way far better than anyone else.
 Dua is devoted to her duties, and is always prepared to shield me from anyone who might wish me harm.
 
 To that end, she constantly has her guard up and will not relax for a second, so that she is always prepared for the unexpected.
 
 As for Ein, it's because he knows of my past, that is why―
 v21cr0151
 クリス「I will ask the two of them to tone down their intimidating attitudes as much they can.」
 
 v22ef0199
 エファ「...Your Highness.」
 v21cr0152
 クリス「In exchange, though I know it is not my place to ask, please do not come to resent them.」
 
 v21cr0153
 クリス「Both Ein and Dua value the safety of this kingdom and its princess more than anything else, that is why their manner is so..」
 
 v21cr0154
 クリス「Especially Ein― for Ein is...」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0200
 エファ「...Your Highness?」
 \nEfa seemed confused by the hesitation that had crept into my speech.
 Though it may make the conversation awkward, I said no more.
 
 black450
 v21cr0155b
 クリス「(―I should not speak of that to Efa or anyone else.)」
 ...If Efa learns of my past, I am sure it will depress her.
 
 And to ensure that the tragedy does not repeat itself, she would surely keep her distance―
 bg60a01
 efa_a04
 v22ef0201
 エファ「―Your Highness?」
 v21cr0156
 クリス「...Please do not worry.」
 v22ef0202
 エファ「But, you were about to say something about Ein, then just broke off...」
 Efa looked anxious.
 
 \nI felt guilty about leaving her in the dark.
 v21cr0157
 くりす「Well, Ein's just twice the worrywart compared to normal people.」
 Though that was no lie, I still apologized inside my heart for hiding things about one of my retainers to her.
 
 v21cr0158
 クリス「That's why, please try not to... you know?」
 efa_a02
 v22ef0203
 エファ「Yes. I understand what you're trying to say.」
 As I smiled, Efa returned my smile faintly.
 Both Ein and Dua have responsibilities and must act appropriately.
 v21cr0159
 クリス「(―The same goes for I and Efa...)」
 I considered this more deeply.
 Everyone is their own person, and has their own lives to worry about, so I mustn't abuse my status by being selfish and complaining.
 
 v21cr0160
 くりす「(―But, if...)」
 There's a slight possibility of us being able to share a future together, like something out of a dream...
 v21cr0161
 クリス「(―And if Efa wishes for it...)」
 Perhaps I should ask her about it, pretending to jest, but in truth being entirely serious―
 efa_a01
 v22ef0204
 エファ「―Is something wrong?」
 But as I faced Efa, my body stiffened and I couldn't make myself say the words.
 v21cr0162

 efa_a05
 v22ef0207

 Earlier, I had asked Coco to wait outside of the room until the tuning was over.
 
 v21cr0167
 クリス「(―And here I thought I would definitely be done in just five minutes...)」
 I'd gotten distracted by chatting with Efa, forgotten about Coco, and it looks like she must have lost her patience―

 If anyone were to go missing in this place, it would be natural that I take responsibility for the search.
 
 But since Efa has offered her help, the affairs of the nation should be my top priority.
 
 v21cr0170
 クリス「Then, I beseech you, Efa. I am counting on you.」

 エファ「―Yes!」
 So I lifted the sides of my skirt, hoping to hasten my arrival to the office.
 
 Bg56A01
 v21cr0171
 クリス「(―Thank you. Efa.)」
 As a result of Efa's resolute face and eager reply, I smiled faintly myself, reassured.
 
 I cannot stand the fact that they place Efa inside a case and make her sleep.
 
 A living doll should be allowed to walk among humans.
 But by making her experience time so, they've fated her never to know what it is to truly live―
 v21cr0172
 クリス「Aside from that, what am I going to do after the memorial ceremony?」

 The words that I hadn't had a chance to say earlier awoke inside my mind once more.
 v21cr0173
 クリス「Would you like to remain in Weiss and live with me?」
 
 
 I know that I ask for the impossible, but I cannot help but feel there is a glimmer of hope... or am I merely fantasizing?

 K_BGM04
 The way Lord Jussi speaks is starting to grate on my nerves.
 The manner in which he repeats the same things over and over again utterly exasperates me.
 
 However, as the Princess' representative, I must wait patiently until the preparatory meeting has concluded.
 
 v25du0154
 デュア「(―I hope this is over soon...)」
 It's obvious his documentation is insufficient, and he has no excuse.
 
 Yet the man in question refuses to acknowledge his lack of preparation, and continues to ramble, stretching out the length of the meeting.
 v28ju0194
 ユッシ「...That is why I ask you, do you not recognize the matter, Lord Ronberg?」
 
 v25du0155
 デュア「(―There he goes, calling Ein by his surname again.)」
 It appears he is trying to remind the audience of Ein's father, Fritz Ronberg. This is a flat-out attack on Ein.
 
 Since Ein is not fazed at all by your posturing, please cut the gaudy speech.
 v25du0156
 デュア「(―Or is my thinking reflective of my own inexperience?)」
 As a matter of fact, he was actually dismissed from office.
 
 \p\wBut he somehow convinced the cabinet master to give him a new position, thus he's an assistant minister at the moment.
 I was there when it happened. It was the first time I've ever seen a grown man cry like a child.
 
 jus_b04
 v28ju0195
 ユッシ「So, what do you think, Lord Ronberg?」
 v24ei0192
 アイン「Concerning whether I should issue funds for the expense of this foreign affair?」
 jus_b01
 v28ju0196
 ユッシ「That's right. Have I not been speaking of that all along?」
 If Jussi were a swordsman, he would be using the same kind of feint over and over, each time intending to strike at his opponent's heart.
 His moves are so obvious that if this were a battleground, he would have been killed with a single strike.
 
 v25du0157
 デュア「(―But, this is the royal court, not a battleground. Furthermore...)」
 Whenever he is driven into a corner, he begs for his life to be spared. That's the main reason he's been able to keep his position until now.
 
 v25du0158
 デュア「(―I suppose this must be Lord Jussi's own way of life... or something.)」
 He seems as foolish as ever. But it is not just that...
 v24ei0193
 アイン「Very well. Then let us include half of the total amount you requested in the draft budget.」
 
 
 jus_b03
 v28ju0197
 ユッシ「O-only half!?」
 v24ei0194
 アイン「That's correct.」
 jus_b01
 v28ju0198
 ユッシ「I cut every possible expense I could think of before proposing this, and now you say I only get half of it? Are you mocking me?」
 
 v24ei0195
 アイン「I too understand that it is an unreasonable offer.」
 v24ei0196
 アイン「―Or is it that you dare not accept half, Lord Jussi?」
 
 jus_b05
 v28ju0199
 ユッシ「Grrrr...」
 That Lord Jussi was quite disturbed by the compromise that Lord Ein was offering was evident on his face.
 v24ei0197
 アイン「It's precisely because it is you, Lord Jussi, that I challenge you with such an unreasonable offer. Do you not understand?」
 
 v28ju0200
 ユッシ「B-but...」
 v24ei0198
 アイン「Please.」
 Ein asked directly, without mincing words further.
 jus_b04
 I could not judge how he would react... but Lord Jussi smirked and nodded thrice in satisfaction.
 
 v28ju0201
 ユッシ「K-kuh... W-well, if that is your decision, then I guess I have no choice.」
 
 v28ju0202
 ユッシ「Very well. If there are any complaints about it during the voting later, I shall have no trouble silencing them.」
 
 v25du0159
 デュア「(―My, my.)」
 Now that the assistant foreign minister has accepted Lord Ein's offer, his permission shall be the shield used to silence any dissent.
  
 
 v24ei0199
 アイン「...In addition― or you could say in exchange― I shall be rejecting that proposed salary increase for the export control officials.」
 
 jus_b03
 v28ju0203
 ユッシ「W-what?!」
 v24ei0200a
 アイン「...I understand that their task has grown more difficult as of late.」
 jus_b07
 v28ju0204
 ユッシ「Then why!? Why should we not compensate them accordingly!?」
 
 
 v24ei0201
 アイン「Though it is true that they have more work to do, the number of hours that they work remains the same.」
 
 v24ei0202
 アイン「...Thus, I decided that rather than increasing the salary of the officials, wouldn't that money be better spent hiring assistants to reduce their burden?」
 
 jus_b01
 v28ju0205
 ユッシ「Grrr... then what about... increasing the officials' salary, but taking a portion of that to hire assistants...」
 
 v24ei0203
 アイン「Were that so, it is possible some officials might hire themselves as their own assistants, would they not?」
 jus_b06
 As Ein's tone became more stern, sweat began pouring down Lord Jussi's brow.
 
 v28ju0206
 ユッシ「...Grrr.」
 v24ei0204
 アイン「If we raised the salary of our officials, we would have to supervise them more closely as well.」
 
 v24ei0205
 アイン「―I imagine for the two of us responsible for foreign affairs, a stack of paperwork we would never see the end of would await―」
 jus_b03
 v28ju0207
 ユッシ「Fuahh―! Please wait! I would not wish to put you to that trouble―」
 
 v24ei0206
 アイン「Well then, rather than inflate our bureaucracy, the both of us shall personally assist the export control officials in their task.」
 
 jus_b01
 v28ju0208
 ユッシ「......O-oh. H-hmmm?」
 v24ei0207
 アイン「Is there still something else?」
 v28ju0209
 ユッシ「Umm, what I mean is... if we were to assist them, would they not foist their duties upon us?」
 
 It is rare indeed that Lord Jussi demonstrates he is capable of rational thought.
 In response, Ein smiled reassuringly at him.
 v24ei0208
 アイン「Worry not. If unreasonable requests come your way, I am sure a stern look from you will put a stop to that.」
 
 v24ei0209
 アイン「You are a man of august presence, Lord Jussi.」
 jus_b04
 v28ju0210
 ユッシ「Oh. Ohhh! That's right! That's right! All the tedious work gone in a stroke!」
 
 
 
 v24ei0210

 v28ju0211
 ユッシ「Hm? Is that all right?」
 
 v24ei0211
 アイン「If it is a pressing matter, then I shall hear their complaint... and settle the matter discreetly.」
 jus_b02
 v28ju0212
 ユッシ「H-ho. So you're also quite... never mind. I shall be counting on you, then.」
 
 Lord Jussi looked well-satisfied. It seemed he had somehow misunderstood what Ein meant.
 
 ―In truth, I thought Lord Jussi had just been tricked.
 bg58a01
 v24ei0212
 アイン「Well then, next shall be Hans. Forgive the delay.」
 han_b04
 v27ha0142
 ハンス「Y-yes!」
 Hans, who had not said a word until this point, sounded startled as he replied.
 
 
 After all, he is about to give a report based on what he's learned from these last two years spent in the Blue Kingdom.
 
 v27ha0143
 ハンス「My general report was included in the documents that were sent here before I returned in person... was there something the matter with it?」
 v24ei0213
 アイン「No, nothing in particular. It was a well-written report.」
 han_b02
 v27ha0144
 ハンス「Thank you very much.」
 v24ei0214
 アイン「Then, let me ask you a few questions.」
 han_b01
 v27ha0145
 ハンス「Y-yes.」
 Most of the questions Ein asked were concerned with the doll trade in the Blue Kingdom.
 bg58a01
 He asked questions such as how often the export of dolls occurred, and if the destination of the exports changed as they were being transported.
 
 
 
 v25du0160
 デュア「(―Sounds like a complicated issue.)」
 But it was still far preferable to listening to Jussi's rambling.
 v24ei0215
 アイン「―I see. So a new doll crafting technique has been discovered in the Blue Kingdom.」
 
 
 han_b04
 v27ha0146
 ハンス「That's right! They've actually made a considerable number of interesting innovations.」
 
 v24ei0216
 アイン「Oh?」
 v27ha0147
 ハンス「You've already seen dolls such as Coco. As you can see, they're quite comical beings.」
 
 
 
 Watching Hans chatter on so animatedly, it is hard to believe he's the same man who had been dead silent for hours before.
 
 v27ha0148
 ハンス「...What a wonderful technique this is!」
 v25du0161
 デュア「(―That Hans... no, I guess this is exactly like him.)」
 Since Hans craves knowledge, it's natural that he is completely enthralled with these foreign Doll arts.
 
 v24ei0217
 アイン「...You've become rather knowledgeable about dolls, Hans.」
 han_b02
 v27ha0149
 ハンス「A, t-that's... that's not true at all. This is all just secondhand knowledge, nothing extraordinary.」
 
 Said Hans modestly, though he seemed to wish to continue.
 
 
 It was evident from how he burned with excitement; his face and posture seemed to say, ‘This is only the beginning!’

 v25du0163

 I had mixed feelings about someone I'd never call a comrade speaking on my behalf.
 
 ...But then, what he said next was―

 I cannot stand even to hear the name of that man!

 Now I am angry at myself for sympathizing with him, just a moment ago.

 アイン「What shall we do, Hans? I, for one, do not mind either way.」
 
 han_b05
 v27ha0150

 Pressed for a decision, Hans' confidence vanished and he looked in my direction.
 
 v25du0166
 デュア「(―You won't get an answer by looking at me like that, you know...)」
 He should just make such a simple decision by himself.
 han_b03
 v27ha0151
 ハンス「T-then... I will continue next time.」
 v24ei0219
 アイん「Very well. All that remains is to report to the Lady and bring this meeting to a close―」
 \p\wUpon hearing that, I glanced at the clock. There were still a few minutes left before the Princess was due to arrive.
 
 v28ju0215
 ユッシ「Hmmm. Is it not too early to end here?」
 han_b02
 v27ha0152

 Cut short, Hans sighed dejectedly.

 bg58a01
 v25du0167
 デュア「(―Did he just say important meeting for grown-ups?)」
  
 
 I recalled the face Jussi had made earlier when Ein had left him equally flustered. It made me chuckle a little.
 jus_b01
 v28ju0218
 ユッシ「Hm? What is it, Dua? Is something amusing?」
 
 
 v25du0168
 デュア「No. It's nothing.」
 \nThat had been rude of me.
 v28ju0219
 ユッシ「Look, Hans. Even Dua can see you've made a fool of yourself.」
  
 
 It was my fault for chuckling at an inappropriate time, but what does he mean by ‘even’?
 v28ju0220
 ユッシ「For goodness' sake. Look at you, a man who has been the White Kingdom's representative for three years―」
 
 
 v27ha0154
 ハンス「...If you would let me be so rude as to make a correction, Lord Jussi, my commission was only for two years...」
 v28ju0221
 ユッシ「Argh, why are you so fussy about the details! That's the very reason you're always getting ordered around by Valery...」
 
 bg58a01
 v25du0169

 Lord Jussi should just appoint himself the Royal Bother. If he did that, no one could find fault with―

 ハンス「L-Lord Jussi.」
 v28ju0222
 ユッシ「...What?」
 bg58a01
 v25du0170
 デュア「(―Hm?)」
 After Lord Hans said his name nervously, Lord Jussi suddenly grew tense as well.
 v28ju0223
 ユッシ「Ah, you see... Hans became indebted to Valery during his time in the Blue Kingdom. Isn't that right, Hans?」
 
 In an unexpected turn of events, Lord Jussi was desperately trying to downplay his words from earlier. What had caused him to act this way, I wonder?
 Whereas Hans was staring at Ein like a mouse cornered by a cat.
 ein_b01
 v24ei0220
 アイン「―Is something the matter?」
 v27ha0156
 ハンス「N-nothing at all!」
 v28ju0224
 ユッシ「...Um, it's nothing, yes!」
 bg58a01
 In spite of their obviously suspicious replies, Ein began browsing through his papers again as if nothing had happened.
 
 ―However,
 jus_b01
 v28ju0225
 ユッシ「U, um, Lord Ronberg?」
 v24ei0221
 アイン「What is it?」
 v28ju0226
 ユッシ「Regarding Lord Valery... have you any thoughts about him?」
 Lord Jussi purposely steered the topic back to Valery.
 v24ei0222
 アイン「...I do not quite understand what you mean.」
 jus_b04
 v28ju0227
 ユッシ「Lord Ronberg. What do you think of the man called Valery?」
 v24ei0223

 v24ei0224
 アイン「Have you some concern regarding Lord Valery that I should be aware of?」
 jus_b01
 v28ju0229
 ユッシ「H-hmph. Of course not.」
 As he said that, he turned away and faced my way for a moment,
 and then focused his glare on me.
 jus_b04
 v28ju0230
 ユッシ「But you see, Dua and Valery...」
  he said in a most insinuating manner, turning back to Ein.
 
 At the mention of my name,

 Then the bell marking the eleventh hour, and thus the end of the meeting, sounded.
 Provided the Princess had completed Efa's tuning without incident, she should be on her way to the office at this very moment.

 Obediently, I left the room and proceeded down the hallway.

 chr_a02
 v21cr0176
 クリス「I understand. All of you have my gratitude.」
 v21cr0177
 クリス「Now, there are some matters I wish to discuss with Ein.」
 At those words, both Lord Hans and Lord Jussi bowed in assent, then filed out of the room in succession.
 
 I remained a little concerned about what Lord Jussi had wanted to say earlier, so I thought of pursuing him, but―
 
 chr_a01
 v21cr0178

 v25du0174

 Since she had asked me to stay, I could not disobey.

 v21cr0179
 クリス「What I wish to speak of concerns Efa.」
 v21cr0180
 クリス「Today, in the midst of Efa's tuning, I happened upon some abnormalities.」
 v21cr0181
 クリス「...A more comprehensive diagnosis will take time, but it appears to me that she is under stress due to being so far from home.」
 
 chr_a04
 v21cr0182
 クリス「Due to that, I have a request I would like to make of you two.」
 chr_a05
 v21cr0183
 クリス「...Could you please treat Efa as kindly as you can?」
 v21cr0184
 クリス「That goes for Coco too. I wish you two to understand that Dolls are, in general, not sophisticated creations.」
 
 v21cr0185
 クリス「If their minds become burdened with too much stress, not even my tuning will be able to restore them.」
 
 The Princess finished what she had to say with a light nod, awaiting our answers.
 My response was obvious, and Ein was one who had pledged allegiance to the Princess as well.
 v24ei0227
 アイン「Efa, is it. I shall do as you say.」
 v25du0175
 デュア「―I too accept your request.」
 Following Ein's assent, I declared mine to the Princess as well.
 chr_a01
 v21cr0186
 クリス「Thank you. That is all I have to say.」
 v21cr0187
 クリス「Now then, Ein. Will you please escort me to my chamber?」

 アイン「Understood.」
 v21cr0188
 クリス「...And Dua― could you please watch over the Dolls in the meantime?」
 
 v25du0176
 デュア「Understood.」
 v21cr0189
 クリス「I let Coco leave the room while I was tuning Efa, but at some point she went astray and I did not see her in the hallway outside.」
 
 v21cr0190
 クリス「Right now, Efa is searching for her on my behalf.」
 v21cr0191
 クリス「It is entirely possible that they have already returned to the Dolls' Room, so please check in there as well.」
 v25du0177
 デュア「Please leave it to me.」
 v21cr0192
 クリス「In the event that they cannot be found, I shall leave the search for them in your hands as well.」
 v25du0178
 デュア「I understand.」
 I bowed deeply in affirmation, then made my way out of the office.
 Bg56A01
 Taking care not to appear that I was in untoward haste, I quietly walked down the hallway, gazing out into the courtyard.
 v25du0179
 デュア「―Coco, eh?」
 ―The doll that hails from the Blue Kingdom. Her strangely affable nature had been hard for me to deal with at first.
 
 But, over the course of three days, I'd gotten used to her, once I'd come to understand I could just treat her as I would a normal child.

 dua_d02
 v25du0180
 デュア「(―I guess if I had a younger brother or a younger sister, they would be like Coco...)」
 dua_d01
 No, that would be impossible.
 For I've not had a brother or sister of any kind.
 
 But hypothetically, if one did exist...
 And furthermore, if it were a boy...
 My late father would have probably stopped telling me, ‘How I wish you were a boy,’ and the Carlstedt House could be sure of its future.
 dua_d02
 v25du0181
 デュア「Haha.」
 It was absurd, but I was picturing Coco sitting in the seat of the family head.
 v25du0182
 デュア「For Coco's sake, I would have to prepare a brand new chair with a stepladder so that she could get on the seat.」
 
 And then, she would have had to endure the grave and solemn atmosphere of the Carlstedt family gatherings...
 dua_d05
 v25du0183
 デュア「...Impossible, for sure.」
 I don't even have to think about it to reach that conclusion.
 There are few suited to be the head of a family.
 ...and neither Coco or I are among them.
 Bg56A01
 dua_d01
 v25du0184
 デュア「Enough of this.」
 I should focus on finding Coco. That will overturn this sullen mood of mine.
 With that thought in mind, I sped up my pace.
 dua_d04
 v25du0185
 デュア「―Hm?」
 As I passed the guest room, I sensed that there were people within.
 v25du0186
 デュア「(―Who is it?)」
 Unconsciously, I placed a hand on the hilt of my sword.
 And then, I pressed my ear up against the door and tried to hear what was happening inside―
 v28ju0231
 ユッシ「I don't like this!」
 v27ha0157
 ハンス「Then, just what... is wrong with the two of them?」
 v28ju0232
 ユッシ「...K-kuhh, you're so fussy!」
 Judging by their voices, it was Lord Hans and Lord Jussi.

 v25du0187
 デュア「(―What should I do?)」
 v25du0188
 デュア「(―Should I pretend I didn't hear anything, or should I investigate?)」
 Last time, they caught me by surprise while I was worrying about what to do.
 So this time I should be the one to make the first move.

 I knocked casually on the door, and awaited their response.

 Soon the door unlocked, and Lord Hans peered nervously out of me from within.

 When I tried to push my way into the room,

 I managed to lure a second person out.

 v28ju0234
 ユッシ「―Hmph. This is just like last time...」
 v25du0192

 ユッシ「Nobody! Did you think Valery was with us?」
 
 v25du0193
 デュア「I cannot tell. That is why I asked.」

 After shoving Lord Hans aside, Lord Jussi stepped out into the hallway and peered up at me.

 jus_b01
 v28ju0239
 ユッシ「Hardly! It's none of your business... and who would want a woman on guard? I am leaving, so you aren't needed here!」
 
 With a gesture that I should be gone as well, Lord Jussi left the room.

 Upon hearing my answer, Lord Jussi waved his hands and sighed, then―
 
 v28ju0247
 ユッシ「Fine, I understand. You may leave. Hans, let's go.」
  After he said his parting words, the two headed towards the other end of the hallway.

 I'm sure he must have been unsatisfied with my rigid, textbook answer to his inquiry.
 v25du0205
 デュア「Well then, I shall take my leave too.」
 I bowed my head to them as they left, wondering why Lord Jussi had asked a question like that.
 
 Could it be that during their meeting the other day, Lord Valery had asked them about my skills as a swordsman?
 
 But even if that was true, it still doesn't really make sense that Lord Jussi would go out of his way to try and compare us...
 v25du0206
 デュア「(―In addition, he even mentioned specific weapons...)」
 Was there some deeper meaning to that? Or was there not?
 Though I was concerned, right now it doesn't matter whether there was or not.
 I must return to my duties, and head for the Dolls' Room.
 I'm sure this feeling of discomfort will more or less vanish once I find Coco.
 
 Bearing that in mind, I felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and even my footsteps felt lighter.

 He was utterly exasperating today!
 v28ju0249

 He will surely regret that he failed to return the favor I did him.
 With a deep breath, I snorted out the ill feelings that had accumulated inside my belly.

 That's right, like Hans!
 Earlier in the guest room, that man―
 v27ha0160
 ハンス「...When you were talking earlier, Lord Jussi, I broke out in a cold sweat.」
  said something like that!
 Are you telling me that you're afraid I might let slip some dangerous secret?
  ...When I asked him that, he just laughed it off.
 v28ju0251
 ユッシ「(―Hmph!)」
 Ein is one thing, and Hans is another.
 Even though we're comrades now, there's a possibility that he might turn against me one day.
 
 
 In politics, one can trust no one. If you do not put your own safety foremost, you will never climb the ranks - that lesson has been deeply engraved into my memory.
 Because otherwise, you'll stumble into the traps your enemies have set, and live the rest of your life in shame.

 v28ju0252
 ユッシ「(―But, that shall not happen this time...)」
 \p\wFaced with Ein, whom one could say is the greatest enemy I have ever confronted, it's natural that Hans would join forces with me.
 Foolish nobles who are content with their current position will never obtain any power.
 
 
 But opportunity smiles upon those with ambition, such as I.
 First I shall regain my position as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then- I shall become ruler of the White Kingdom.
 
 
 
 Since it is I, my subjects can expect to be governed most benevolently.

 I've been thinking this for a while, but Hans has changed since he came back.
 v28ju0259

 It's not like saying nice things about that vexing woman will do him any good.

 han_b03
 v27ha0164

 I let Hans walk in front as we headed down the stairs, while I stayed on guard and kept an eye on my surroundings.
 
 I must keep in mind that a guard could unexpectedly appear at any time, as Dua had earlier.

 It irritates the way he keeps bringing up the same thing over and over again.
 v28ju0268

 \p\wI brought up a topic we hadn't had a chance to talk about since Dua interrupted that first meeting we had with Valery.

 v27ha0172

 ユッシ「Hm?」
 v27ha0174

 v28ju0275
 ユッシ「(―So that's what he meant.)」
 It's not that he was hiding things from me, his comrade, it is just that only Valery knows the whole of this plan.
 
 v28ju0276
 ユッシ「Hey, Hans. I may have asked you this before, but... can we trust Valery?」
 
 han_b01
 v27ha0175

 v28ju0279
 ユッシ「So that ‘thing’ I was asked to create is also...」
 v27ha0177
 ハンス「A necessity for the plan's success.」
 Upon hearing Hans' confident reply, I calmed down slightly.
 Now, all that's left is to wait for the day the plan is to be carried out―
 v28ju0280
 ユッシ「(―Mmgh, but for some reason, I want to know the whole plan.)」
 Is it truly foolproof?
 What if, by some chance, Valery ends up blundering?
 Will he be able to salvage the plan, or will his failure influence my standing... Whichever it is, if I start worrying about things like that, I'll never stop.
 
 v27ha0178
 ハンス「Anyway, Lord Jussi, please just wait patiently for my report.」
 v28ju0281
 ユッシ「Then, when will you be able to report?」
 v27ha0179
 ハンス「―You must have patience. We're the ones that have to avoid attracting suspicion, after all.」
 
 
 v28ju0282

 Even though I cannot agree to this, I have no choice.

 After our conversation ended, Hans headed back towards the castle entrance, leaving me alone in the courtyard.
 
 v28ju0285
 ユッシ「...Hmm.」
 This plan to make Ein lose his standing.
 I don't care about how many people must be sacrificed to ensure that man's downfall.
 
 But, sacrificing Princess Christina is a different matter.
 v28ju0286
 ユッシ「That's because... Princess Christina is Weiss itself.」
 black450
 I have no sympathy for Ein, regardless of what befalls him, but―
 Princess Christina has been wise even in her youth, and she is kind to her subjects. It was as if she were born to succeed the late king.
 
 Apart from that steward I bear a grudge against, I have no quarrel with anyone else.

 ...That's right, I, who know this kingdom the best, am the one who must prevail!

 ユッシ「...Mmm.」
 \p\wIn a dramatic turn from yesterday's weather, it's now pouring so hard that the rain sent up a spray of mist into the air.
 It'd be impossible to reach the castle in this kind of weather.
 I had met Hans in the morning and passed ‘that thing’ to him, and there'd been no problems whatsoever before I'd decided to head to the castle.
 
 ...Though, I had predicted this rain, after seeing some dark clouds slowly drifting this way from the mountains earlier this morning.
 
 jus_d05
 v28ju0353
 ユッシ「But I would never have expected it to start pouring just as I hoped to head back home.」
 The courtyard was filled with curtains of water as far as my eye could see.
  I could even see flashes of lightning in the mountains.
 jus_d01
 v28ju0354
 ユッシ「What a change from yesterday.」
 The preparatory meeting had been troublesome, but I hadn't thought that just heading home would put such a damper on my spirits.
 
 On the bright side, thanks to that conversation with Coco, I now have a clue as to what my next move should be.
 
 v28ju0355
 ユッシ「Everything will work out if I just take care not to reveal too much to that doll.」
 As long as my questions aren't too blunt, I won't be exposed.
 
 v28ju0356
 ユッシ「Still, even if I do that, having a proper conversation with her is a different matter.」
 Whenever that doll speaks, she always drifts off topic really quickly.
 In addition, she's also forgotten a lot of things, which made me suspicious during our conversation.
 
 bg52e01
 v28ju0357
 ユッシ「...Still, what a downpour.」
 If I'd known this would happen, I would have told the carriage to wait for me outside.
 My greatest mistake was not guessing that I'd have to spend my whole afternoon taking care of miscellaneous tasks.
 v28ju0358
 ユッシ「Maybe my servant will become considerate of his master and come for me in the end... yeah, right, that's unlikely.」
 
 It was around the time my servants returned to their own homes anyway.
 v28ju0359
 ユッシ「...Mmmu, I guess I should just loiter about before I go back.」
 It's understandable that my servants got tired of waiting in the carriage and staring at this rain, which will continue falling for some time yet.
 v28ju0360
 ユッシ「...I guess I could kill some time drinking wine.」
 I went back inside the castle, then headed to the wine cellar and finally the guest room.
 SE18c
 Bg56e01
 v28ju0361
 ユッシ「―Still, that Valery.」
 How bold of him to plan an operation that smuggles the ‘wine,’ Princess Christina, out of the kingdom.
 
 v28ju0362
 ユッシ「(―This is interesting, this is really interesting!)」
 \p\wIf this kidnapping operation works out, it'll be the biggest scandal in the kingdom's history, and thus the blame will surely climb to the top.
 
 It won't just be the guard captain, Dua, who will have to take responsibility- even her superior, Ein, shall be at fault.
 
 v28ju0363
 ユッシ「...Kukuku, that's because Ein is too engrossed in his job.」
 There's too many things he needs to keep an eye on, and as a result he'll never be able to see far enough.
 I'm sure that Valery is aiming at that particular weakness of his.
 v28ju0364
 ユッシ「(―Still, Hans said it wasn't a ‘kidnapping’ operation.)」
 Trying to bring Princess Christina out of this kingdom is kidnapping no matter how I look at it.
 
 v28ju0365
 ユッシ「Or could it be that they want her to leave the kingdom willingly?」
 ...I don't know.
 There's one thing I know for sure, and that is that we mustn't let anyone know that we're involved in this operation.
 
 Trying to save the White Kingdom by openly eliminating Ein would make us rebels.
 
 Yet our goal is nothing short of revolution.
 We shall do what we know to be right, whether we become reviled as traitors upon our failure, or praises are sung for us upon our success.
 
 v28ju0366
 ユッシ「...Which means, we'll need more allies after commencing the operation.」
 I'm sure that there are many beyond than the three of us who are dissatisfied with Ein.
 If we can successfully incite them, we can strip Ein of his position and establish a new government for the kingdom.
 v28ju0367
 ユッシ「...Mmmu, in case that happens, I had better go through the list of possibilities now, and figure out whether to involve them later.」
 As I thought of all the work I'll have to do from now on, I realized I really am the most hardworking person in the kingdom.
 
 Unlike Ein, I am not the sort of person who's only good at paperwork and nothing else, so I had best prepare myself for the future.
 
 v28ju0368
 ユッシ「(―Still, I really amaze myself from time to time.)」
 Even though I've drunken almost all of this wine, I can still think so clearly without any problems.
 As expected, I am without peer, and dealing with such minor matters is a piece of―
 v28ju0369
 ユッシ「―Hm?」
 K_BGM09a
 Lost in such thought, I belately noticed a person standing far down the other end of the hallway.
 efa_a01
 Straining my eyes, I saw that it was the doll from the Red Kingdom, Efa.
 She was blankly staring out the window, the two white wings on her back fluttering slightly.
 v28ju0370
 ユッシ「(―Which means Princess Christina is nearby, eh...)」
 I quickly hid the opened wine bottle behind my back.
 
 
 ...It doesn't seem like she can see me from this angle, so I can calm down.
 v28ju0371
 ユッシ「(―Hmm...)」
 It'll be hard getting past that doll to reach the guest room, though.
 
 The only way I can avoid her is to take a roundabout route - taking the stairs down a floor, and then going back up another set of stairs further along.
 
 But that's so troublesome.
 In addition, if I do that, and the doll has decided to leave by the time I arrived at the guest room... I would just feel stupid.
 
 v28ju0372
 ユッシ「(―Come on, just go away.)」
 I decided to hide behind a wall, and wait until the hallway was empty.
 
 v28ju0373
 ユッシ「......Mmmu.」
 It doesn't seem like she's going to budge at all.
 v28ju0374
 ユッシ「(―That's why I hate dolls...)」
 They're so difficult to deal with.
 Maybe I should just make up my mind and go over to her, then somehow convince her to leave?
 
 v28ju0375
 ユッシ「Nggh.」
 Still, the sight of those wings made me hesitate...
 v28ju0376
 ユッシ「(―Though I didn't really mind it that much when I met Coco yesterday...)」
 I just can't bring myself to get close to the Red Kingdom's doll, who, to my eyes, looks just like a human.
 Wracked with indecision, I gazed idly at the wine bottle in my hand as I tried to think of something.
 v28ju0377
 ユッシ「...Hm?」
 Just that moment, I recalled ‘something’ in my mind.
 If I remember correctly, Coco said something about Efa yesterday, what was it again?
 v28ju0378
 ユッシ「Mmmu?」
 v28ju0379
 ユッシ「(―Secret...)」
 v28ju0380
 ユッシ「...That's it, the secret.」
 Coco had said that she had told her secret to the Red Kingdom's doll.
 v28ju0381
 ユッシ「Fufufu.」
 Princess Christina was not beside her.
 This is a perfect chance.
 I can talk to that doll and casually ask her about the ‘secret.’
 By doing that, and only that... that doll will surely tell me what she knew about it.
 v28ju0382
 ユッシ「―That's because she was created in such way that she cannot lie, after all.」
 I had learned about that from one of the Red Kingdom's citizens on the day she arrived... so there was no way she's going to lie.
 I can just ask her Coco's secret, straight out and open!

 エファ「No.」
 v28ju0389

 エファ「By the way... is there something you wish of me?」

 ユッシ「Hm? Ah, no, well, you could say that I do...」
 
 When I finally said the words, the insides of my mouth felt dry.
 v22ef0218
 エファ「...?」
 The doll's eyes traveled from my head to my chest, down towards my hands.
 And when her eyes landed upon the wine bottle I was holding―
 v28ju0391
 ユッシ「T-that's right! About wine.」
 
 At that moment, I finally remember what I was going to ask about.
 v28ju0392
 ユッシ「Do you know about wine?」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0219
 エファ「Yes, I know of it...」

 I must have patience, patience.
 v28ju0395

 エファ「I-I don't know much about that.」
 v28ju0396
 ユッシ「Mmu, then how about the wine's bottle?」
 efa_a04
 v22ef0223
 エファ「...Do you mean the type of bottles they use?」
 v28ju0397
 ユッシ「Mmmuu...」
 It doesn't seem like she was able to take the hint.
 Would it better for me to just stop using code words and ask her straight out?
 v28ju0398
 ユッシ「Then, I have a single question I wish to ask. I need you to tell me Coco's secret.」
 efa_a05
 v22ef0224
 エファ「Eh?」
 The color of Efa's face changed as she heard that, proving that she knew the secret!
 
 
 v28ju0399
 ユッシ「―You do know about it, right?」
 v22ef0225
 エファ「...Y-yes, I do.」
 v28ju0400

 エファ「Coco's secret is...」
 v28ju0401
 ユッシ「Go on, what is Coco's secret?」
 v22ef0227
 エファ「I mustn't say... Coco's secret.」
 v28ju0402
 ユッシ「W-what did you say!? Why!?」
 
 v22ef0228
 エファ「T-that's because... because...」
 The rain was falling noisily outside, and I couldn't hear what she was saying clearly.
 Why is she not telling me at this crucial moment?!
 That's why I hate dolls!
 v28ju0403
 ユッシ「If you don't tell me, it will make things more difficult.」
 v22ef0229
 エファ「C-Coco is... is...」
 \p\wDespite my attempts to persuade her, what came out of her mouth was some half-baked response, not at all straight to the point.

 And then, she shut her eyes tightly, shook her head violently,
 v22ef0230
 エファ「...I mustn't say,」
 \nand said that to me.
 v28ju0404

 Since I hadn't expected that she wouldn't answer, I was at a loss on how to deal with this situation.
 v28ju0405
 ユッシ「(―Wouldn't it be bad if I kept pressing her and she became suspicious?)」
 But this is a rare chance, I can't just throw it away like that!
 ...Wait, even if I don't get the information I want, I can't just let her leave just like this without making sure of her silence.
 
 If she tells Princess Christina about what I asked her― 
 
 v28ju0406
 ユッシ「(―No, that must not happen!)」
 v22ef0231
 エファ「...I'm sorry.」
 v28ju0407

 Just as I meant to turn and reply to the doll with a smile, I realized that nobody was there.
 v28ju0408
 ユッシ「H-huh? W-where is she?」
 
 By the time I realized it, Efa had slipped past me, and started running towards the other end of the hallway.

 v28ju0410
 ユッシ「(―I didn't intend to make her so upset!)」

 Since I don't often run, it was difficult for me to catch up with her.

 Her white wings fluttering, she ran on, going deeper and deeper into the dark halls.

 It was the shadow of her wings that I had seen when the lightning struck.
 I knew well what it was.
 Still, even if my mind understood it, my body was unable to follow suit.
 My legs trembled and my breath became ragged.
 I couldn't banish the thought that the black wings I had seen, at that moment, had betrayed the true nature of that doll- Efa.
 
 
 
 v28ju0417
 ユッシ「(―A-as I thought, dolls are all...)」

 An image of a doll floated to my mind... a doll that did not look a bit like Efa.
 Face, eyes, mouth, nose- all crudely designed, as if they were crafted from scraps of wood simply thrown together.

 The scene that I had relived in my memories was a spectacle shown to the late king ― an experiment to meddle with a doll's free will and force it to do as ordered.
 
 bg52f02

 Its shape like that of a human skeleton, the doll had been taking a leisurely walk at the courtyard.
 
 
 And then, when the engineer ordered it to ‘catch that bird over there-’ all of a sudden, with speed comparable to that of a trained soldier, it went after the pigeon.
 
 
 v28ju0419
 ユッシ「―Mmu.」
 At the moment I saw that, I was overcome by an indescribable feeling.
 
 
 
 Obeying its orders, the wooden doll chased after the pigeon.
 Even when the pigeon took off flying into the sky, it continued its pursuit, leaping over the castle wall with its eyes fixated on its quarry―
 
 sv991a
 v28ju0420
 ユッシ「―You fool!」
 Nobody would have punished it even if it had failed its task.
 
 
 bg52f01
 But it had loyally sacrificed itself in a way none could but praise.
 Indeed, when the late king witnessed that, he lightly clapped his hands and said ‘What a wonderful display of obedience.’
 
 ...I, however, had not shared the late king's feelings.
 The feeling I'd had was difficult to express, but one of greatest discomfort.
 v31xx0001

 v31xx0002
 技師「It seems that it's quite damaged, but―」
 It had lost its right leg below the knee, though the left leg remained intact.
 Though the length of its legs no longer matched, regardless of that, to fulfill the order from earlier... it began to move again.
 
 Knowing that it could no longer walk, it forsook its lower body and depended on the rest, its hands and fingers outstretched as it sought the pigeon that had flown far away.
 
 
 v31xx0003
 技師「―It lives for the sake of its orders.」
 It was just a doll. What I had felt was not pity at the consequence of its stupidity.
 It was... fear.
 Merely because of a order, it would take reckless actions that would cause humans to at least hesitate.
 That was what filled me with fear.

 I scanned my surroundings for her, but I could see little within the darkness.
 My throat ached as I breathed in the warm air, stinking of greenery.

 Before I knew it, she had escaped my sight. I should have chased after her and bid her stop more swiftly.

 ユッシ「...Whatever, no use crying over it.」
 I drank of the bottle straight from its mouth. Refreshed, I shook the bottle slightly.

 It was rather bad manners, but there was no one around to see anyway.
 Now that my throat is less dry, I can think clearly. 
 jus_d04
 v28ju0427
 ユッシ「Fuu, fuu, fuu... all right.」
 My opponent is a doll, so she should not be very clever.
 I'll just have to get tough and force her to answer the question.
 But before I can do that, I have to find her first.

 v28ju0428
 ユッシ「Efa, where are you?」
 
 
 The wind shook the flame of the candle as it blew through, making its light flicker along the hallway.
 From the depths of the hallway, I heard the creaking of a window that had been left open.
 jus_d06
 v28ju0429
 ユッシ「...Mmu.」
 Luckily, all the rooms down this side of the hallway were empty, so there shouldn't be anyone suddenly emerging from them.
 ...But if by any chance someone did―
 jus_d05
 v28ju0430
 ユッシ「That would be pretty bad.」
 
 
 
 Not only was I holding an open bottle of wine, I probably looked quite ragged from that fright I'd gotten earlier.
 jus_d01
 
 Anyway, I had better stash this bottle in the guest room first.
 Though I thought that, when I glanced at the depths of the hallway, I saw something white slip past by.

 ユッシ「Is that... Efa's wing?」

 For an instant, I remembered the shadow of a black wing that had spread out upon the ceiling earlier and made me stop short...
  But I'm fine now.
 Now that I knew what it had been, I did not fear it.
 jus_d04
 v28ju0432
 ユッシ「Quite so!
 That's the limit of a little girl's ability to frighten me!」
 I decided to forge ahead.
 The next corner was just a short distance away.

 ユッシ「...Hey, Efa. Are you over there?」
 There was no response.

 Is it because she can't hear me? There was no response at all from the darkness.
 v28ju0435
 ユッシ「(―Damn, there are many places she could have hidden around here.)」
 Why must I deign to play hide and seek with her?

 My mood gradually grew fouler.

 She had better show herself when I'm still being nice, or else...

 ユッシ「...Where are you?」
 
 
  I had passed by a staircase.
 Could it be that Efa had gone downstairs?
 Or could it be that she had gone further into the depths of the hallway?
 v28ju0437
 ユッシ「Damn it, where did she―」
 Bg56b02
 Just as I took a few steps down the stairs, thinking that she probably didn't go down them―

 I sensed that somebody was behind me, and turned to look back...

 ハンス「Oh, Lord Valery!」
 I recognized the person whom I met in the hallway as Hans.
 
 From the way he rushed towards me the moment we saw each other with scarcely an eye for his surroundings, it seems that he had been waiting for me. 
 v26va0079
 ヴァレ「My, my, to have you go out of your way here to welcome me. ...Have you been waiting long?」
 
 han_b01
 v27ha0184
 ハンス「No, that's not the matter at hand...」
 v26va0080
 ヴァレ「(―Why, of course. Since this is the place I promised that he could find me if necessary.)」
 v27ha0185
 ハンス「I just thought that if I were to wait here, I'd definitely be able to meet with you, Lord Valery.」
 
 v26va0081
 ヴァレ「Hm?
 Today is the day I must give my official greetings. We should be able to converse in the meeting sooner or later―」
 han_b06
 v27ha0186
 ハンス「B-but I can't wait that long.」
 The high pitch of Hans' voice clearly indicated his anxiousness.
 v26va0082
 ヴァレ「(―That is only natural...)」
 After all, an incident like that had happened.
 v26va0083
 ヴァレ「(―Well, the fate he met... was just a matter of sooner or later.)」
 
 
 Of course, I couldn't say that in front of Hans, so I kept the thought to myself and just gave him a silent smile.
 I had no interest in agitating Hans any further than this.
 v26va0084
 ヴァレ「...Well, what is it that you want to tell me, then?」
 v27ha0187
 ハンス「You don't have to be evasive, you understand, don't you!?」
 v26va0085
 ヴァレ「Isn't your voice a little bit too loud, Lord Hans?」
 han_b03
 v27ha0188
 ハンス「Ah, yes. My apologies.」
 His behavior was not intentional... but more due to his way of life.
 Even though he had status and power, he still engaged in daily interaction with people unworthy of his status, thus being contaminated by their habits.
 
 One such habit was that whenever he felt anxious, he would speak his mind without reserve.
 
 
 
 v26va0086
 ヴァレ「(―That's why, I will forgive you for that, Hans.)」
 You are different from those incompetents.
 You have the courtesy to apologize for what you did, and reflect on your actions, just as you are doing now.
 v26va0087
 ヴァレ「You are speaking of Lord Jussi, right?」
 han_b06
 v27ha0189
 ハンス「Y-yes...」
 v26va0088
 ヴァレ「(―Hey, now.)」
 Why are you getting shaken for? Isn't this what you wanted to talk about?
 Seizing the initiative and not carelessly surrendering it to one's opponent take is fundamental, right? 
 
 
 han_b01
 v27ha0190
 ハンス「Lord Valery, what are... your thoughts?」
 v26va0089
 ヴァレ「You mean, concerning Lord Jussi's death, right?」
 v27ha0191
 ハンス「Yes.」
 v26va0090
 ヴァレ「Well, according to the explanation during yesterday's funeral, didn't they say he succumbed to ‘a sudden illness?’」
 I had never thought that my first task as a new ambassador would be to attend Jussi's state funeral.
 han_b04
 v26va0091
 ヴァレ「Are you unable to accept that?」
 v27ha0192
 ハンス「...Did he really die of illness? Could it be that he was involved in some trouble, and...」
 
 
 han_b01
 Hans glanced around to see if anyone else was nearby.
 v26va0092
 ヴァレ「(―I see, so he has doubts about Jussi's death.)」
 Quite perceptive... though I would have liked to praise him, such suspicion came naturally to one in my position.
 In addition, his suspicion had arisen from his cowardly personality, rather than his rationality.
 For one, he already had a suspect in mind.
 And those eyes clouded with fear as he spoke to me was evidence of that. 
 v26va0093
 ヴァレ「(―Hmph.)」
  He dared not say that he suspected me.
 I thought that one should at least conceal that kind of expression when conversing, as it would naturally cause difficulty in our relationship... but I wonder if it applies here?
 v26va0094
 ヴァレ「It seems hardly possible, but by any chance could it be that you suspect me, Lord Hans?」
 han_b06
 v27ha0193
 ハンス「O-of course not!
 I would never do such a thing!」
 The way he denied it so vehemently made it hard for me to contain my laughter.
 I had hoped his response would be one of simple incredulity, as he feigned his ignorance. 
 In this conversation, since the question has not yet been raised, he should have said ‘suspecting you of what?’ as the correct reply.
 If only he would just calm down a little, we could surely regain each other's trust.
 v26va0095
 ヴァレ「So you have doubts, Lord Hans.」
 v27ha0194
 ハンス「What are you talking about, Lord Valery! If you knew the extent of the faith I have in you...」
 
 v26va0096
 ヴァレ「There, there, please wait a minute. I speak not of myself... but you feel doubt about the cause of Lord Jussi's death, right?」
 
 han_b03
 v27ha0195
 ハンス「......Ah, y-yes.」
 v26va0097
 ヴァレ「If so, then I feel the same way too. I cannot accept their claim that such a driven man died of illness so suddenly.」
 han_b01
 v27ha0196
 ハンス「That's right, that's absolutely right.」
 v26va0098
 ヴァレ「―Well then, if it was not ‘sudden illness,’ then what was it?」
 v27ha0197
 ハンス「...Um...」
 v26va0099
 ヴァレ「Perhaps the cause of his death is one that must be hidden no matter what... or something.」
 han_b03
 v27ha0198
 ハンス「...U-um...」
 v26va0100
 ヴァレ「It could be that someone did him in or something... hahaha, do I jest too much?」
 
 v27ha0199
 ハンス「......」
  Hans gave no response, his face a most unhealthy color.
 v26va0101
 ヴァレ「(―Hey, at least laugh a little with me.)」
 In conversations, matching one's flow with your opponent is crucial.
 But since he couldn't do that, I would have to lead him along instead.
 v26va0102
 ヴァレ「Whatever the reason, Lord Jussi has already passed away. That, at the least is a fact.」
 han_b04
 v27ha0200
 ハンス「...Yes.」
 v26va0103
 ヴァレ「All I can say is that we have lost a person valuable to us... but there might be those with the opposite sentiment.」
 
 The instant he heard my implications, Hans' eyes started swimming.
 han_b01
 v27ha0201
 ハンス「―By ‘opposite,’ you mean?」
 v26va0104
 ヴァレ「(―Don't play dumb when you understand what I'm saying.)」
 Hans was different from Jussi. He uses his head.
 But, though he has something in the way of intelligence, he is too cowardly to be cunning.
 He was not brave enough to follow his thoughts to their conclusion.
 If he could just perceive and understand that about himself and aspire to overcome it, he wouldn't have handled this situation right now so boorishly.
 v26va0105
 ヴァレ「Well, he was like a bothersome speck in Ein's eye, so I believe Ein thinks of this incident as conveniently ridding him of a nuisance.」
 han_b02
 v27ha0202
 ハンス「Ah, ooh, I see.」
 Hans brightened up. It seems that he calmed down after hearing that.
 For some reason, the way that he honestly agreed with me bothered me.
 v26va0106
 ヴァレ「(―Oh well.)」
 Rather than making demands of him, I decided to use a method with greater subtlety.
 han_b01
 This is ideal as a test for Hans, and as a rehearsal before I use it on Ein later.
 
 v26va0107
 ヴァレ「Nevertheless, Lord Hans. A human's death is not an easy thing to understand.」
 v27ha0203
 ハンス「―Yes.」
 v26va0108
 ヴァレ「It has been but a week since I met Lord Jussi. I never thought that the wine we drank together- at that time- would be our last.」
 
 
 v27ha0204
 ハンス「...Indeed.」
 v26va0109
 ヴァレ「Whoops, I didn't intend to imply that was the ‘last wine’ for Lord Jussi.」
 v27ha0205
 ハンス「...?」
 v26va0110
 ヴァレ「I just wanted to say that in my view, that time was the last for Lord Jussi.」
 
 
 han_b03
 v27ha0206
 ハンス「...O-oh.」
 v26va0111
 ヴァレ「(―A good answer.)」
 Looking at his face showed clearly that he understood nothing of what I had said. I smiled in response.
 v26va0112
 ヴァレ「Well then, now for Lord Ein.」
 han_b04
 v27ha0207
 ハンス「What do you mean by―」
 v26va0113
 ヴァレ「Oh no, don't worry about it. You'll understand soon.」
 v26va0114
 ヴァレ「(―Hans is innocent. He had nothing to do with Jussi's death.)」
 And there was no sign that Ein had stabbed Jussi in the back, either... for now, that is.
 What remains is to be cautious, and take care that Ein does not suspect we are the ones who killed Jussi.
 v26va0115
 ヴァレ「By the way, this may seem to be a foolish question, but is Lord Ein the man with the long hair?」
 v27ha0208
 ハンス「Yes.」
 v26va0116
 ヴァレ「―Oh, so it was him.」
 ...That man I had seen from the horse carriage, that is.
 han_b01
 v27ha0209
 ハンス「Have you met him somewhere?」
 v26va0117
 ヴァレ「Yeah, we merely passed each other at castle gate.」
 If my intuition is correct, my opponent this time shall be a formidable one.

 I, and Dua who was right beside me, rose from our chairs and welcomed the ambassador from the Blue Kingdom with courtesy.

 It was the man sitting in the horse carriage that I had brushed past at the castle gate.
 v26va0120
 ヴァレ「My my, thank you so much for welcoming me especially.」
 The one who had entered the room by Hans' side smiled and spread his arms wide, then gave us a slight bow in response.
 
 And then, as if he had calculated the precise moment to do so, Hans broke in.
 v27ha0211

 v25du0244
 デュア「The honor is mine. I am Dua Carlstedt.」
 Dua, whose behavior was much stiffer than Valery's, responded to his greeting after a moment's hesitation.
 
 
 As Valery had noted, the two of them had met before.
 According to her description of the situation at that time, their relationship could be said to have gotten off to a rocky start.
 v24ei0232
 アイン「Well then, I'm afraid that is the end of our introductions, so please have a seat. I believe our main topic today is the matter of the memorial ceremony.」
 
 val_b02
 v26va0123
 ヴァレ「Yes, of course, the pleasantries should be left until the end... should they not?」
 With a composed expression, Valery nodded in agreement.
 ...Still, there was something about him that bothered me.
 v24ei0233
 アイン「(―It was just as Dua had said, he's an eccentric man.)」
 His personality was transparent in not only his speech, but all of his behavior.
 Beneath his ingratiating smile dwelled a smirk of contempt.
 
 
 v24ei0234
 アイン「Then, first of all, regarding the memorial ceremony―」
 v24ei0235
 アイン「I'm sure that you are familiar with it already, but please allow us as the host kingdom to reacquaint you.」
 
 
 val_b01
 v26va0124
 ヴァレ「Please do.」
 After receiving his assent, I began the explanation.
 bg57a01
 As the kingdom established by the peace treaty between the Blue Kingdom and the Red Kingdom, the White Kingdom holds this ceremony for the sake of celebrating the ongoing peace.
 
 The memorial ceremony shall be held in three weeks' time.
 From the day before until two days after the memorial ceremony, the White Kingdom shall not collect the usual border tolls, and passage in and out of the kingdom shall be allowed freely.
 
 And at the time of the memorial ceremony, in consideration of the problem of insufficient security, we shall be borrowing troops from both the Red and Blue Kingdom.
 
 
 
 val_b01
 v26va0125
 ヴァレ「Oh, Lord Ein.」
 v24ei0236
 アイン「...Yes, is there something the matter?」
 v26va0126
 ヴァレ「That the Blue Kingdom shall be increasing the troops on loan is stated clearly in the documents that you've sent, but is the number of troops from the Red Kingdom changing?」
 
 
 
 
 
 v24ei0237
 アイン「Yes, both kingdoms shall be providing the same amount of troops.」
 
 
 val_b02
 v26va0127
 ヴァレ「If the total number is still insufficient, please do say. The Blue could provide as many troops as you desire.」
 
 
 
 v24ei0238
 アイン「No, but thank you for your kindness.」
 val_b01
 v26va0128
 ヴァレ「Is that so.」
 If I carelessly accepted that proposal, the other kingdom would surely insist that they be allowed to do the same... thus, pointless conflict would arise, which I must not let occur.
 
 As the small White Kingdom is surrounded by the other two kingdoms, it is crucial to maintain good relations between those kingdoms to preserve our own security.
 
 
 
 val_b02
 v26va0129
 ヴァレ「My apologies for interrupting your speech. Please continue.」
 v24ei0239
 アイン「Very well.」
 bg57a01
 While the town below the castle holds its superb festival for the occasion, guests from the two kingdoms shall be feasting, conversing and enjoying the numerous entertainments planned within the Dornstein Castle.
 
 
 And one of those entertainments is a collaborative theater performance between the three kingdoms, ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings,’ that shall be performed in the court hall before the guests from every kingdom.
 
 The play known as ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ was written as an autobiography by the first queen of the White Kingdom, and its story portrays the vicissitudes of the development of doll arts.
 
 We had thought this play to be perfect for the occasion, but―
 
 
 
 After we had chosen it, a matter of concern had arisen.
 And that was that most of the representatives from the two kingdoms which will be attending the memorial ceremony on that day have already seen that play before in the past.
 
 When we were informed of that, the preparations were already well underway... so it would be difficult to change the play to be performed.
 
 In regards to that, the Blue Kingdom had proposed a solution; to spice up our performance by altering a portion of the play's story- that is, make the ending a bolder one.
 
 　ブリュー
 
 v24ei0240
 アイン「Lord Valery, when will the modified script arrive?」
 val_b01
 v26va0130
 ヴァレ「According to the scriptwriter's letter from some days ago, it is to be finished in three days.」
 v24ei0241
 アイン「...So it will arrive in time for the rehearsal a week from now, yes?」
 v26va0131
 ヴァレ「Yes, of course.」
 The Blue Kingdom had said ‘since the proposal was ours, we would hope to be in charge of altering the script’, in which we had accepted.
 　ブリュー
 
 
 
 v24ei0242
 アイン「Do you know the details of how the contents will be changed, Lord Valery?」
 val_b02
 v26va0132
 ヴァレ「No, regretfully I do not. But I do know that the change will be more than a mere increase in the number of performers.」
 In the end, questions still remained regarding the contents of the modified script.
 v24ei0243
 アイン「―All right, now that I have confirmed those matters... do you have anything else you wish to discuss, Lord Valery?」
 
 val_b01
 v26va0133
 ヴァレ「Indeed. I suppose that's all there is to say regarding the memorial ceremony.」
 bg57a01
 Admitting that he had nothing to add, he shook his head, and loosened the buttons on his neck as if he wished these formal matters would be over with.
 
 dua_b04
 Watching his behavior, Dua narrowed her eyes for an instant, as if to remonstrate our guest's inappropriate manner. 
 
 
 
 It seems that I too must speak the words to end this.
 bg57a01
 v24ei0244
 アイン「Lord Valery, have we not spoken enough of the ceremony?」
 val_b03
 v26va0134
 ヴァレ「No, no, I'd be most obliged if we had.」
 v24ei0245
 アイン「(―Hm?)」
 Valery's unexpectedly carefree tone of voice naturally put me back on guard. 
 v26va0135
 ヴァレ「If you ask why, I'm still newly appointed, so I could hardly breathe in this tense atmosphere.」
 v24ei0246
 アイン「Haha, a fine jest.」
 In my opinion, it seems far more tiresome to make small talk with him.
 val_b02
 v26va0136
 ヴァレ「Oh, do you not believe me?」
 Suddenly, he glanced at me and spoke with a feminine tone of voice. 
 This was far more uncomfortable than I had expected.
 v24ei0247
 アイン「―Well, let's just leave it at that.」
  I replied back with words that were neither accusing, nor apologetic.
 Since he now knew I was aware he was trying to waste my time with his posturing, he should not persist in it.
 That means, the next thing he will say is―
 val_b01
 v26va0137
 ヴァレ「Concerning the sudden death of Lord Jussi― I give my condolences.」
 his straightforward condolences. 
 bg57a01
 v24ei0248
 アイン「(―So here he comes.)」
 I was thinking of responding diplomatically with a courteous nod, but I paused.
 In actual fact, Lord Jussi had died from falling down the stairs.
 ...But at the scene of the event, there had been an open bottle of wine by his side, so to protect the deceased's honorable reputation, we had decided to announce that his death was caused by sudden illness.
 
 
 The truth was known only to I, Dua, the coroner, and the Osbourne family.
 The accident had happened just before the memorial ceremony.
 If the fact that we tried to cover up this incident were exposed, who knows what kind of problems would arise.
 v24ei0249
 アイン「(―Should I be courteous, or should I probe deeper?)」
 I, too, must be cautious since I have no idea what he plans to say next.
 If we continue on this topic of conversation... the situation would only get worse.
 val_b01
 v26va0138
 ヴァレ「―Nevertheless, Lord Ein. A human's death is not an easy thing to understand.」
 v24ei0250
 アイン「Yes, it puts one at a loss what to do when events like these happen so suddenly.」
 v26va0139
 ヴァレ「It has been but a week since I met Lord Jussi. I never thought that the wine we drank together- at that time- would be our last.」
 
 
 He had emphasized the phrase ‘at that time,’ as if he meant to imply something.
 
 v24ei0251
 アイン「(―Is he talking about the time when he provoked Dua into a fury?)」
 
 
 On that day, Dua had reported that he had spoken of wine during their quarrel.
 
 
 
 bg57a01
 v24ei0252
 アイン「(―What's more, he's speaking of this in front of Dua and Hans...)」
 dua_b01
 Naturally, the other two who were present realized what Valery was talking about.
 dua_b04
 Dua seemed as if she wished to say something, but in the end, she held her tongue.
 bg57a01
 han_b04
 On the other hand, Hans was staring straight at Valery, obviously shaken.
 Bringing up such a dangerous topic of conversation... does he hope to gain something from this?
 If so, why has he gone out of his way to drag Hans along with him as he jumps into the fire?
 bg57a01
 v24ei0253
 アイン「(―No.)」
 The reason he speaks of this so openly must be because he has confidence that Hans will not expose him.
 ...Whatever it is, there is no reason for me to avoid this topic of conversation.
 val_b02
 v26va0140
 ヴァレ「―Is there something the matter, Lord Ein?」
 v24ei0254
 アイン「No, I was merely thinking about the one deceased.」

 v24ei0255

 v24ei0256

 K_BGM09B
 v24ei0258
 アイン「(―This man...!)」
  I understood what he was trying to say now.
 bg57a01
 It was not that he was bringing up the matter of illegal wine exports. 
 Valery was trying to tell me, with the phrase ‘the last wine,’ that he knew the cause of Jussi's death.
 
 
 
 
 
 v24ei0259
 アイン「...Is that so.」
 How did the information leak out?
 The people who knew the truth of Jussi's death besides me and Dua were...
  only the coroner and Jussi's relatives, the Osbourne family.
 Rather than hypothesizing that Valery had somehow convinced the coroner to tell him, it was much more likely he had gotten that information from someone in the Osbourne family.

 v24ei0265

 To gauge if Valery had knew of the true manner of Jussi's death, I had lied that ‘there was no one by Jussi's side in his final moments’ to observe his reaction.

 But that method depended on who one's opponent actually was. From observing Valery's reactions, I could not be one hundred percent sure. 
 v24ei0266

 Regardless, I must remain skeptical, considering every possibility and entertaining every doubt.

 I mustn't deny the possibility that Efa, whom the Lady is so fond of, was directly involved in Lord Jussi's death.

 A few days had passed since the unfortunate event that befell Lord Jussi, and I believed her spirit has calmed down.

 Upon that stormy night, Efa had suddenly came to my chamber, banging on my door.

 v22ef0239

 Watching my uneasy manner, Efa said,

 v22ef0240
 エファ「Please don't worry. You can ask me whatever you want, I'll be fine.」
 She clasped my hands in hers.
 v21cr0200
 クリス「Thank you. Then, I hope it won't be unpleasant for you to answer.」
 efa_a01
 v22ef0241
 エファ「Yes.」
 I knew roughly what had happened from listening to her heart as I was tuning her, but not the final moments of it.
 I could just peek into the Memory Stone directly and find out what I wanted to know, but that wasn't something that I as a tuner ought to do.

 v22ef0245
 エファ「What... for?」
 v21cr0206
 クリス「I knew not of it, but Jussi―」
 The way he had chased after our guest Efa, even inside the castle of his home kingdom, was behavior I could not have forgiven.
 
 
 
 
 
 If the Red Kingdom were to officially make known their displeasure with this event, as the representative of this kingdom, I would have to provide them with equivalent compensation.

 Efa shook her head anxiously, then clasped my hands.

 クリス「That's right, it's not something he should force out of you.」
 efa_a03
 Upon my agreement, Efa smiled and her wings fluttered up and down, as if with happiness.

 I was not proud to lay the blame upon one so recently deceased, but Jussi was in fact the one at fault in that particular exchange.

 Rather than eating her own supper, the Princess was busying herself taking care of Coco.
 As she watched Coco relish her meal, she smiled a satisfied smile.

 デュア「(―The Princess truly has a kind heart...)」
 She is of the Dornsteins, whose descendants are fated to become doll engineers from the day they are born.
 Since the late king was too a good-natured person, my father always said the same thing of him.

 Thanks to Lord Ein, sitting beside me, even a person ill at ease in this situation as I has can still hold the post of guard captain.

 I do not intend to fill my current position just by relying on the influence of my father's rank and the recommendation of the Princess's steward.

 Well, I do agree with him on that, but―

 He should at least examine his own behavior before he goes around lecturing others.

 Since I had been with him for most of the day today, I knew the truth of that secret.

 ev903c
 v22ef0265
 エファ「Yes. I'm eating properly, so do not worry.」
 Now that she mentioned it, I noticed that Efa hadn't been eating much.
 It might not be something I should worry myself over, since I don't really know much about dolls―

 エファ「Yes. Thank you for worrying for me.」
 v25du0310

 Now that I think of it, I hadn't really had any chances to talk with Efa.
  Having a face-to-face conversation like this with her was a first for me.
 v25du0311
 デュア「(―Still...)」
 I noticed that Efa's face looked much more relaxed compared to the first time I had met her. 
 It could be due to the contrast with Coco... but when I had first met Efa, I had thought of her as a flower in the shade, about to wilt.
 
 But after merely our brief conversation at this dining table, I knew that I had been mistaken.
 v25du0312
 デュア「(―Is it because of the princess?)」
 No, not only her, I'm sure that Coco too had a role in Efa's transformation.
 In addition―
 v25du0313
 デュア「(―The Princess has cheered up because of Coco and Efa as well.)」
 No matter how we retainers try, we can never enter into the Princess's world of doll tuning. 
 The only ones that are able, are the ones receiving that tuning― the dolls themselves.
 Could it be that just as these two dolls were cared for by the Princess, the Princess too was able to obtain those whom she could confide in?

 ココ「Did I, sound like Ein―?」
 v25du0315

 Just like that―
 The Princess, Efa, and Lord Ein- and I- gazed towards Coco's side of the table, watching her every movement.

 Embarrassed, Coco shook her head.

 Just watching from beside me was certainly not helping at all.
 v24ei0347
 アイン「...Well, if you could arrange these for me I'll be really grateful.」
 I lifted up the bundle of documents I had finished going through, moved it to the side, then put the pile down on the side of the desk in front of her.
 Though the papers were a bit big, arranging them should still be possible for her.
 
 
 v24ei0348
 アイン「...Can you do it?」
 coc_a02
 v02co0545
 ココ「I'll do, my best. Hmm, hmm...」
 coc_g01
 ―Ton Ton, Ton Ton.

 The sounds of Coco's work filled the office room.
 v24ei0349
 アイン「Right, that's the way. Can you arrange them in groups of five sheets?」
 coc_g07
 v02co0546
 ココ「Kayー」
 Unexpectedly, after handing over that work to her, I felt that my own work was going more smoothly.
 Not wanting to make her wait too long, I browsed through the documents with a much quicker pace than usual.
 And then, at the moment I passed her the final page...
 coc_g03
 v02co0547
 ココ「What is this―?」
 I looked at the document I had handed Coco, it was an agreement related to exports.
 ‘―Agreement Contract for the Delivery Date and Payment of the Export Products―’
 The contents for this document were on a different level from the planting of potatoes earlier, it was difficult to explain to Coco.
 Thus, I tried my best to simplify my words and explain to her our trading with Blew.
 
 
 v24ei0351a
 アイン「...This is an evidence of an agreement made that will be kept after the transaction occurs.」
 After saying that, I observed Coco's reactions.
 But of course, she only tilted her head. Had I used too many abstract words?
 coc_g05
 coc_a05
 v02co0549
 ココ「...Sounds difficult.」
 v24ei0352
 アイン「...Not at all. For example, I'll write down an agreement that you can make.」
 
 To teach her the meaning of contracts, the fastest way is to show it to her via practical means. Besides, this makes a good break from work.
 
 
 With that thought, I brought out a piece of paper, wrote ‘While Ein is holding the pen, I will keep some distance from his desk and go play by myself’, and then showed it to Coco.
 
 
 
 
 v24ei0353
 アイン「What do you think? With this, you can make an agreement with me, Coco.」
 
 coc_g02
 v02co0550
 ココ「Yup yup, I agree.」
 Coco nodded twice, then suddenly opened her eyes wide and rushed towards the curtains of the window, hiding behind them.
 
 v24ei0354
 アイン「What's wrong, Coco?」
 coc_a05
 v02co0551
 ココ「You're holding the pen, so I must stay away.」
 v24ei0355
 アイン「...Hahaha, sorry. I didn't notice.」
 Acting before she thinks... she was just like a human child.
 That must be one of the main reasons Coco so is adorable.
 v24ei0356
 アイン「...Do you want to try signing this document?」
 coc_g02
 v02co0552
 ココ「Eh―, can I really―?」
 v24ei0357
 アイン「Yup, I don't mind.」
 coc_a05
 v02co0553
 ココ「But, but. I... don't, know, how to write.」
 v24ei0358
 アイン「Then I'll teach you. Your name is Coco, so―」
 coc_a01
 After calling for Coco to come back and sit on her chair, I wrote ‘Coco’ on another piece of paper for her to see.
 
 And then, I passed the pen to her, pointed down at the paper,
 v24ei0359
 アイン「Come on, try imitating that.」
  and encouraged her to practice.
 coc_a07
 v02co0554
 ココ「Yup yup!
 My name is Co―Co.」
 While she gripped the pen and wrote her name again and again, I judge whether her handwriting had gotten steady.
 
 And then, after deciding that the time is ripe, I had her sign the real contract document.
 v24ei0360
 アイン「...Very well, it seems like you have properly signed it. Well then, now is the time for your reward for helping out.」
 There will always be a price in return for making an agreement, otherwise it wouldn't be called a ‘contract’.
 
 coc_a02
 I pulled open my drawer, and brought out the box of cookies I had prepared for Coco beforehand.
 
 v24ei0361
 アイン「Good work. There are five inside this box here.」
 coc_g07
 v02co0555
 ココ「...Wah―!
 There's so many macaroons―」
 After opening the box, Coco shouted in delight.
 Watching her smiling face, I noticed that even I felt delighted.

 ココ「Thank you, thank you. Is it okay, if I eat them―?」
 v24ei0362
 アイン「Sure. But don't eat too many.」
 v02co0557
 ココ「Kay!」
 Coco delivered the round macaroon into her wide-open mouth, and munched it with a satisfying expression.
 And then, just as I thought she was going to eat a second one―
 coc_g02
 v02co0558
 ココ「Good, work.」
  For some reason, she held it out to me instead.
 v24ei0363
 アイン「Is that a reward for me doing my work?」
 coc_g01
 v02co0559
 ココ「Yup. You've always, been working hard.」
 v24ei0364
 アイン「(―Fufufu. To think Coco would offer me words of appreciation...)」
 I accepted the macaroon with a pleasant feeling inside my heart, and delivered it to my mouth the same way Coco had.
 coc_a01
 v02co0560
 ココ「Is it delicious?」
 v24ei0365
 アイン「Yes, very.」

 I wonder what would happen if Dua were around now.
 She would surely say ‘Please do not eat while you're working!’ with steam rising from her brow―

 ハンス「(―So the day has finally come...)」
 Today was the day of the rehearsal held one week before the real memorial ceremony.
 
 bg54a01
 The interior of the castle, usually quiet, was filled with ruckus from the preparations taking place since last night. Even we nobles were requested to lend the manpower of our servants to help with the preparations.
 
 
 That includes this hall as well, it's in the progress of a major renovation.
 v32xx0001
 使用人「Master Hans. Where shall we assist?」
 v27ha0227
 ハンス「Listen to and follow the orders of Ein's head servant, who is setting up the stage.」
 v32xx0002
 使用人「Understood.」
 I had only three servants at my disposal, but they too have lent their services to the preparations. 
 
 There is a reason why this rehearsal requires almost as much preparation as the real memorial ceremony.
 
 That is because, the ‘visitors from abroad’ invited to view this rehearsal are also scheduled to attend the real memorial ceremony performance.
 
 han_d01
 v27ha0228
 ハンス「...It's almost time.」
 The interior of the castle will truly become busy from this moment onwards.
 That's because, it's almost time for the advance observers- the representatives of the Red and Blue kingdom to arrive.
 The two kingdoms' representatives will be watching this rehearsal in place of the kingdoms' rulers in order to be familiar with the flow of the ceremony's events. 
 v27ha0229
 ハンス「As for my own duties...」
 han_d03
 It's depressing to say it, but I don't have any.
 Even though this rehearsal is supposed to be as close as it can be to the real performance, I shouldn't have to feel so tense.
 
 Even if there are some minor mistakes, they will be forgiven as long as they are not repeated during the ceremony.
 han_d01
 ...However, for me, today was THE day.
 If I fail this time, everything will be finished.
 I have but one chance.

 Clinging to that feeling, I recalled everything that had happened.

 For this day, I had labored diligently.
 For this day, I had sacrificed much.
 For this day, I had suffered many sleepless nights.
 han_d04
 v27ha0231
 ハンス「...Now, it is time.」
 To do what I came to this hall for.
 I swiftly placed the ‘thing’ I had received from the late Lord Jussi amongst the other stage tools.
 
 v27ha0232
 ハンス「(―And now, the only task left will be to...)」
 I clutched tightly the gems in my pocket, and went out into the hallway, careful not to attract attention.

 ハンス「(―Please watch over me, Lord Jussi.)」
 At this moment, I needed all the blessings I could get.
 ...Even if they're from a person who left this world with his wish unfulfilled.
 
 
 I had hoped that he would at least become my mental support, in exchange for the times where I couldn't depend on him. 
 Bg56A01
 I headed down the hallway, my destination being the dolls' room.
 Their chamber was located far from all of the facilities in use today, and the guard stationed there had been called to the central part of the castle.
 
 
 
 If my information is correct, the only one presently inside the dolls' room is―

 I had done sufficient research on Coco's approach to conversation.

 v27ha0239
 ハンス「By the way, are you alone now?」
 v02co0688
 ココ「Yup, Efa isn't around―」
 The tuning for the ceremony was done for Coco first, and then Efa.
 Afterwards, Coco was to return to this room, while Efa will go and meet the representatives.
 
 
 
 
 
 I had come to visit this room knowing clearly about that schedule.
 v27ha0240

 v02co0692
 ココ「When did you come, to the White Kingdom, Hans―?」
 v27ha0244
 ハンス「(―Oh, I see.)」
 For a moment I had thought she had lost her memories because of Princess Christina's tuning, but it seems I had been mistaken.
 
 
 I haven't met Coco even once since I returned to the White Kingdom.
 The times where I saw her were one-sided occasions where I watched her rehearsals from afar.
 v27ha0245
 ハンス「...I came here quite some time after you did.」
 coc_a02
 v02co0693
 ココ「Oh, I see―. Ah, please wait a bit.」
 v27ha0246

 Coco slowly nodded, and emerged from the gap of the door.

 She closed the door behind her,
 v02co0694
 ココ「What's the matter―?」

 v27ha0247

 coc_g01
 v02co0696
 ココ「The room, is a mess. I didn't clean up. So, you can't go in.」
 I was shocked that she wouldn't let me in.
 She wouldn't have been able to refuse such a request at the time I had met her in the Blue Kingdom.
 v27ha0249
 ハンス「(―The Princess's education had made her cleverer, eh?)」
 Still, that excuse was not enough to stop me.
 For I, who must conclude this matter before anyone passes by who might interfere, I cannot waste time just standing here in the hallway.
 v27ha0250
 ハンス「That's okay, Coco. I don't mind even if the room is a little messy...」
 coc_a04
 v02co0697
 ココ「Hmm... really?」

 coc_g05
 v02co0698
 ココ「Umm, still, no way―」
 v27ha0252
 ハンス「(―S-she's become so cheeky...)」
 
 When I first met her in the Blue Kingdom, she would always respond naively without any evidence of thought.
 v27ha0253
 ハンス「Why can't I?」
 coc_a05
 v02co0699
 ココ「Because it's not just my own room, so no way―」
 v27ha0254
 ハンス「...So you're saying it's because Efa also uses the room, is that it?」
 coc_a07
 v02co0700
 ココ「That's right―」
 Seeming happy that I had understood what she was saying, she nodded earnestly.

 If I force my way into the room, it would only create a commotion.

 Rather than wondering what to do, I decided to finish this quickly.

 black450
 v02co0701

 Wary of someone suddenly passing along the other side of the hallway, I invited Coco to come and hide behind a pillar.
 
 And then, slowly, I slid my hand into my pocket―

 v27ha0258
 ハンス「...I want you to look at this.」
  and brought out one of the gems in my hands.
 v02co0702
 ココ「Whoa―, it's so pretty―!」
 There are two properties of a gem that will captivate the attention of a doll, the first is high density... and the second is good compatibility. 
 This gem has the highest level of density, and in addition, its compatibility with Coco was exceptional.
 Why, if you ask―
 v27ha0259
 ハンス「(―That is because this gem was mined from the same vein of the gems Coco has within her.)」

 v02co0705
 ココ「Ehー?」

 The answer should be obvious.
 sv904a
 v02co0706
 ココ「―Umm, no way―」
 v27ha0264
 ハンス「E-eh!?」
 ...How many times has she said ‘no way’ already? 
 v02co0707
 ココ「Because, this is yours, right, Hans?―」
 v27ha0265
 ハンス「No, err, this is... well, you could say that... it is.」
 I can't say that I got it from Lord Valery, nor can I say these are mine either.
 v02co0708
 ココ「This is important to you, right―?」
 v27ha0266
 ハンス「Well, that's right, but...」
 v02co0709

 black450
 v27ha0267
 ハンス「(―Kuh, what a miscalculation!)」
 Why is she being so considerate, rather than accepting it without hesitation, like a child would have!
 Now that it's come to this, I'll have to forcibly―
 v27ha0268
 ハンス「(―No, that would only make things worse.)」
 If I cause her to resent me, it will increase the chance of failure.
 Is there any way out of this?
 v27ha0269
 ハンス「Well, I would be really happy if I could give this to you, Coco...」
 sv904c
 v02co0710

 If I had thought this might have happened, I should have deepened my relationship with her beforehand by speaking with her more.
 v27ha0272
 ハンス「(―What to do, what should I do...)」
 v27ha0273

 I know about that―」
 v27ha0274

 v02co0713
 ココ「Ein taught me about that. Re-ward―. A reward is given, for keeping a promise, right?」
 
 v27ha0275

 I thank Lord Ein for his invisible assistance, even though my plan will hardly repay the favor.
 
 v27ha0276

 Coco was created by an old engineer who loved children, and she was created to always enjoy helping people.
 
 
 
 It was just as had been written in the records that the old engineer left.
 Though I had never met that engineer who had created Coco, most of my knowledge of dolls had came from the books she'd written.
 
 v27ha0278
 ハンス「(―In that sense, she is like a mentor to me.)」
 
 When I return to the Blue Kingdom, I shall visit the grave of this mentor of mine and pay my respects.
 I will tell her that the doll that she made has obediently done as she has taught...

 Why would Coco ask for something difficult like that?

 Has she any idea of the countless amounts of documents I have signed in these two years, morning and night!?
 v27ha0286
 ハンス「...Well, what kind of contract do you want? Shall I specify the penalty for disobeying the contract as well?」
 
 Right after I finished saying that, I realized how foolish I was being.
 What am I doing speaking of such things to a child- no, not even that, but a doll?
 There is no need for me to take this kind of child's play seriously.
 v02co0722

 This was as time-consuming as explaining the notion of contracts to her... no, it's yet more troublesome than that.
 Going out of my way to leave written evidence like this when there is no need to, how foolish can this―
 
 v27ha0289

 I hastily tore that page from my notebook, and put it in her hands after reconfirming that nobody else was around.

 Now if worse comes to worst and someone has seen us, I can just explain it by saying that I was playing along as she practiced writing her own name.

 エファ「(―At least, I never felt this way before I came to this kingdom.)」
 After the audience with the representative of the Red Kingdom ended, I was permitted to go back to my room, so I slowly made my way there while reminiscing idly of the past.
 
 I would always be awoken when I was needed to perform in a play, and after a few months, I would have to bid farewell to the other actors that I had become acquainted with.
 
 In that memory of mine, disturbed by countless interruptions, the people I remembered aged in time unknown to me, and when we managed to meet again, they would sigh and say― 
 
 v33xx0001
 役者「‘―Oh, Efa. You are as beautiful as always...’」
 ...And then they murmur, ‘You never change.’
 v22ef0277
 エファ「(―It's not that I don't want to change.)」
 It is because I, being something other than human, have no right to change... is what I told them.
 
 Regardless of that fact, people expect the same of me as they would of a human, but sometimes they will make note of the differences between us, with words of praise or glances of envy.
 
 Were they wishing that they could be more like me, or that I were less like them?
 v22ef0278
 エファ「(―Which is it, I wonder?)」
 Until now, I had thought the two were contradictory.
 And tragically, before I could ever seek an answer to that question, the play would end and it would be time for me to go into my long sleep.
 
 v22ef0279
 エファ「(―But, this time is different.)」
 Since coming to the White Kingdom, an unbelievable amount of freedom has been given to me.
 Not only in the time I have spent awake, but I have had greater opportunity to interact with others.
 And among those people, I believe that I had been greatly influenced by two of them- Her Highness, and Coco.
 Her Highness was a tuner, so she had known all about me.
 Coco was like a different type of doll compared to me, she was full of charm.
 v22ef0280
 エファ「(―She's much more human than I am...)」
 Looking at Coco, I could somehow understand the reason that humans had glanced at me in envy.
 I could never become Coco, not on the outside, nor in the inside.
 But, if only I were able to become like her...
 Aren't ‘dreams that will never come true,’ like that one, something which humans yearn for?
 
 Dreaming of a place where anything can happen, and chasing after it even though they know it is but an illusion...
 black450
 v22ef0281
 エファ「(―For a long, long time.)」
  I have been wandering in such a world.
 
 
 The fleeting dream that I, a doll, can imagine that I'm a human is one that can only be realized on stage.
 v22ef0282
 エファ「(―It feels sad to be alone...)」
 As I saw the stairs from the hallway, I was reminded of Lord Jussi.
 The man who slipped, fell down the stairs and passed away on that stormy night... Could he have just been feeling lonely and wanted to talk with me?
 Even if that had been true, there was no way I could apologize to him for my behavior.
 v22ef0283
 エファ「(―I'm sorry.)」
 
 After praying for him silently, I begin walking more swiftly as I headed for my room.

 Since Coco is no doubt bored of playing with her toys by now, I have to quickly return to the room before she starts playing hide and seek out in the hallway.
 
 v22ef0284

 In fact, the reason I was making haste was because I wanted to see Coco as soon as possible.
 After turning at the corner, I calmed my breathing, and knocked on the door.

 エファ「Coco, I'm back.」
 But, there was no response from Coco within the room.
 v22ef0286
 エファ「...Could it be that she already went somewhere?」
 There is still some time before the rehearsal later,
 but, if we were somehow to be late for that―

 v22ef0287
 エファ「―Oh, Coco. What a relief. It's me, Efa.」
 SE06A
 v02co0731

 Coco had welcomed me from within, herself as she always was.
 With the sensation that a weight had lifted off my chest, I went into the room.

 coc_a01
 v02co0732
 ココ「Nuh uh. I didn't―」
 As I looked at Coco's happy expression, instead of the relief that I should be feeling, for some reason I was unsatisfied.
 
 What is this unease I am feeling?
 v22ef0289
 エファ「...Hey, Coco. You were lonely by yourself, right?」
 coc_g04
 v02co0733

 v22ef0290
 エファ「?」
 coc_a08
 v02co0734
 ココ「Being alone is sad, right―?」
 v22ef0291
 エファ「...Ah.」
 For an instant I found Coco's reaction odd, but I realized that I had caused this myself.
 
 With the way I asked her that question, it is as if I had wanted her to answer that she was lonely.
 
 v22ef0292
 エファ「(―I'm sorry.)」
  I apologized to Coco inside my heart, then took her hands.

 Oh, that's right―. Can you, can you, wait a bit?」

 Coco brought over a small box from a table behind her.
 v22ef0295
 エファ「...What's that?」
 v02co0737
 ココ「Cookies―」
 v22ef0296
 エファ「Is there something about them?」

 Coco thought for a while.

 v22ef0298
 エファ「Oh, could it be that you got them from Ein again?」
 v02co0740
 ココ「Nope. They're not from Ein.」
 A while ago, Coco had gotten some cookies as a reward from Ein.
 Unfortunately, she had dropped them and they became crumbled, but they had still been delicious.

 v02co0741
 ココ「The other one, is for, Dua.」
 She said that, and since she didn't have any for herself, I shared half of mine with her, and she had been surprised.
 
 When I asked why, she had said that Her Highness had done the same thing.
 Upon hearing that, for some reason I knew not... I felt truly happy.
 
 v22ef0300
 エファ「(―If Her Highness knew that I did the same thing as she did...)」
 v02co0742
 ココ「Hmm. Who... gave this, to me again?」

 At the sound of Coco's voice, I returned to my senses and remembered what we were talking about.

 I had heard that many people came to the castle to assist in the preparation of today's rehearsal.
 
 v02co0746

 We need not welcome them all, so it was no concern of ours, but I had already seen the large amount of people going in and out of the castle by looking out the window to the courtyard.
 
 v02co0747

 I suppose there might be someone Coco had known amongst them.
 v22ef0304

 coc_a01
 v02co0748
 ココ「Umm, I don't think that person is from the White Kingdom. Also, it's a much greater person, you know―?」
 
 
 
 If it's a ‘great person’ that is not from the White Kingdom, that person could only have come from either one of the Red or Blue Kingdom. 
 And amongst those two kingdoms, the people that Coco knew would probably have come from―
 v22ef0305
 エファ「Did that person come from the Blue Kingdom?」
 
 
 
 
 coc_g07
 v02co0749
 ココ「Yup yup, that's right! It was a person from the Blue Kingdom. He gave this to us to eat―」
 
 
 v22ef0306
 エファ「...Is that so.」
 I'm sure it's because Coco was well-known in the Blue Kingdom.
 
 
 That's why that person had brought local cookies here for her.
 coc_g01
 v02co0750
 ココ「He said, that we should eat it, before the play. And he also said, that's because if we're hungry, we might mess up.」
 
 v22ef0307
 エファ「Fufufu.」
 coc_a03
 v02co0751
 ココ「Efa, which one do you want―?」
 As I watched Coco reach into the box, it seems she was determined to eat them.
 
 v22ef0308
 エファ「You're so impatient.」
 coc_a07
 v02co0752
 ココ「Ehehe.」
 As I recalled the time when that little doll's tummy grumbled during the formal introduction when we had first come to the White Kingdom, I could barely contain my laugh. 
 
 v22ef0309
 エファ「(―At that time, Coco's tummy grumble did wonders for the atmosphere.)」
 coc_g01
 v02co0753
 ココ「Here, here, Efa. Take whichever one, you like―」
 v22ef0310
 エファ「Eh, but...」
 bg60a01
 Encouraged by her, I peered inside the box, seeing many small cookies inside.
 
 I wasn't hungry, but I felt it would be rude to decline, so I took just one.
 
 coc_a03
 v02co0754
 ココ「Yup yup, I'll have too―」
 With a cookie in each of our hands, we counted to three together and delivered the biscuit to our mouths at the same time.
 ...After chewing, I found its taste mysterious, I've never eaten anything like this before―
 coc_a07
 v02co0755
 ココ「Hey hey, Efa. Do you want another one?」
 v22ef0311
 エファ「...S-sure. Only one more, okay?」
 Just like that, we kept saying ‘only one more, only one more’ and reached inside the box repeatedly, and before I knew it, the box became empty in a matter of minutes.
 
 coc_a05
 v02co0756
 ココ「We ate too muchー」
 v22ef0312
 エファ「...Indeed, and I had intended to eat only one at the beginning.」
 coc_g08
 v02co0757
 ココ「My tummy, is so, fullー」
 v22ef0313
 エファ「...Mine too.」
 After grinning sheepishly at Coco, a sudden sense of fatigue invaded me, and when I came to my senses, I was already sitting down on Coco's bed.

 Not only my body, but even my wings and my eyelids felt heavy.

 I was asked to bring Coco to the hall.

 It's no great concern if Coco is the one that forgot about it, but if Efa did...

 Just as Coco had said, Efa was there on the bed.
 But, somehow... her expression did not look healthy.

 Are you feeling ill?」
 v22ef0323

 v25du0346

 I drew close to Efa, and placed my hand on her forehead.

 In addition, her gaze seemed to be out of focus.
 efa_a01
 v22ef0324
 エファ「I'm fine... besides, it's time for the rehearsal...」
 At her mention of the rehearsal, I was reminded that I had been tasked to quickly fetch these two to the hall.
 
 But I dispersed that thought immediately.
 v25du0348
 デュア「(―Am I an idiot!?)」
 It was my job, as the person of authority right now, to take into consideration the current situation and make the best decision based on it.
 No doubt this would upset the schedule, but those matters can be left for the higher authorities to solve.

 It was a voice that I had not expected. For an instant, I had thought that the Princess was around and that order had been hers. 
 
 ...But that was impossible.
 It was hard to believe, but that voice had came from―

 For an instant, the image of Efa inside my mind had overlapped with that of the Princess.

 Just like that misconception I had had earlier, her behavior made me feel as if I was in front of the Princess, so I couldn't bring myself to force her.

 Should I trust Efa's words, or should I prioritize her safety?
 Which was the right way? Which one was truly for Efa's sake?

 Just a few minutes before the rehearsal of ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ was to begin, Dua had finally reported her arrival.
 There were drops of sweat on her forehead. It seemed she had been in a hurry.

 アイン「...So it seems.」
 bg54b01
 There was an audience of about thirty in this hall, the venue for the play.
 According to the plan, there will be a slightly larger audience in attendance at the real performance, so we had placed the approximate number of seats in consideration of that.
 Furthermore, in case anything unexpected were to happen, there were ten guards stationed around here, not counting Dua.
 The flow of the rehearsal today will be exactly in line with the actual performance, so these guards are expected to be deployed the same way on that day as they are now.
 v24ei0368
 アイン「(―Still...)」
 Regrettably, not all the guards are from our kingdom, some of them are on loan from the other kingdoms... so I couldn't regard this as thoroughly secure.
 As well as four soldiers from our White Kingdom, there were three each from the Red and Blue, so this was hardly an advantageous situation for us. 
 
 Furthermore, as the majority of the important personages of the White Kingdom gathered in, the security elsewhere in the castle is lax.
 
 Seeing that we will have to assign bodyguards to these personages during the actual performance, we might have just enough guards to retain our usual level of security throughout the whole castle.
 
 black450
 v24ei0369
 アイン「(―And that in itself is just barely enough...)」
 No matter where inside the castle, we must have the highest of guards deployed in that area be from the White Kingdom- in short, our reliance upon the aid of the other kingdoms must not surpass half from either kingdom.
 
 
 Still, no matter how skillful our commanders in each of their designated areas are, whether the other kingdom's soldiers will follow their orders obediently is another matter.
 Even if those foreign soldiers do not mention it, there are no doubt quite a few of them that feel a sense of humiliation being under the command of a small kingdom such as ours.
 
 
 It's questionable whether we could effectively utilize their power when the crucial time comes, as they would be no different from an unorganized mob. 
 
 v24ei0370

 Even though I knew that this outcome was caused by our financial problems and our decision to neglect our military in consideration of the two kingdoms, looking at the reality in front of me was―

 The princess had asked me to anticipate this rehearsal performance and relax during it, waiting until the actual day of the ceremony to be businesslike as usual. 
 
 What I had was only the summary of the play's flow, and the timing schedule of the use of the various stage tools and lighting.

 But still, as if she had suddenly gained a burst of energy, on the last step, Coco hopped in front of the Princess.

 Gripping the Princess's skirt, Coco stretched her back and tried to present her face to the Princess.

 In response, the Princess smiled naturally as she gently leaned downwards.

 v21cr0355
 クリス「What beautiful eyebrows, what clear and transparent eyes, and what cogent speech. You are without fault, Angel's Egg.」
 After saying that, she cupped Coco's cheek in her hand gently.
 Though Coco did not make a very suitable target for her actions, the audience below the stage was immersed in the show, and did not laugh.

 At the corner of the stage where the Princess pointed laid a fluttering, blood-red cloth.
 After it was removed, hidden behind it was a mountainous pile of dolls that will never move- dolls that are merely ‘dolls.’

 Though I couldn't hear what she was saying, her left hand was curled into a fist before her chest, seemingly cheering them on.

 The story of the play continued. While educating the Angel's Egg, the queen performed research into a new discipline of Doll Arts by herself.
 The Angel's Eggs other than Coco did not have any stage appearance and were described only by the speeches of the queen. Slowly, the dolls that had fallen to oblivion increased.

 The Angel's Egg had grown to the level of understanding a human's heart.

 v21cr0384
 クリス「...When you reach the status of an Angel, I would have to return you there.」

 The two on stage looked into each other's eyes.
 Both of them searching for the next words to speak.

 v02co0813
 ココ「Then why are you troubled?」
 v21cr0385
 クリス「......」
 coc_h01

 v02co0815
 ココ「...Because?」
 v21cr0387
 クリス「...No, that is enough. I shall tell you that when the time comes.」

 The queen then shooed the Angel's Egg away as if she were but a servant.
 But then, before the yellow triangle of her hat was about to disappear into the wing of the stage―
 chr_a05
 v21cr0388
 クリス「―Oh Egg. Are you prepared to become an Angel?」
 shouted out the Princess resolutely, as if she had made up her mind.

 bg54b01
 ...And so, the act ended, and light returned to the hall.
 The tense plot development gave rise no applause, but instead sighs from the audience.
 One by one, people stood up... and others stretched in their seats.
 
 The people who rose from their seats were mostly the representatives from the Red Kingdom. I stared in amazement as those who arose exceeded the number of my fingers.
 
 Apparently, they have a custom of wearing a hood upon their head to veil their eyes, though I do believe it's quite dangerous to walk around like that in a dark place like this―

 I saw that she was annoyed, so I agreed with her.

 Because of the long period of being seated, several times more women had arisen than had men.
 
 Most likely, they had matters to take care of during the intermission.
 v24ei0387
 アイン「(―Next up is Efa's performance as the Angel that Coco has grown up into, eh?)」
 On the stage, the people in charge were swiftly spreading a red carpet and bringing in the props for the new set.

 The story will continue until the Angel achieves self-awareness, and sets off on a journey away from the queen.
 Though I know that part of the script has been changed, I still don't know the specifics of how the story will reach that ending.
 
 v24ei0388
 アイン「(―Am I the only one in the audience whose palms are sweating?)」
 I couldn't imagine Efa making any mistakes, so there should be no further need to worry about the play itself.
 ...But, what is this feeling of unease I have?

 I'm sure she must have been upset by the finale where Efa pushes me down and straddles me.

 It is but a feeling of excitement, as the second half of the play is about to begin.

 v22ef0344
 エファ「―Yes.」
 v21cr0421
 クリス「...Then that is enough.」
 Unlike the time I had Coco practice with me, I felt nervous in this conversation.
 So this is how Margeret Dorn, the first Queen I am performing as, interacted with dolls...
 
 v21cr0422
 クリス「(―Playing her takes a lot of effort.)」
 Compared to the dauntless Queen, I was a tuner that treated dolls more kindly.
 Within the role of my ancestor, Queen Margeret, I felt as if my Doll Arts skills had increased. 
 
 ...But that is wrong.
 v21cr0423
 クリス「(―At this moment, I am not Christina.)」
 Standing upon this stage, I must become the first Queen herself.
 
 
 ...Having set my mind, I continued the play alongside Efa.
 Soon, as the Angel began to gradually gain self-awareness, the queen became distressed.
 v21cr0424
 クリス「One day, you shall have to set out on a journey away from me.」
 When I said that line, I was able to relate to it.
 ...But, saying that with my own lips on stage before Efa was―
 efa_a02
 v22ef0345
 エファ「...I would not do something like that. I shall always be by your side, My Queen.」
 The manner in which she denied it added weight onto my heart.
 v21cr0425
 クリス「(―That's right, the time where Efa will be leaving me has come.)」
 The more I imagined Efa as the ‘Angel’ that the first queen had raised,
 the more I was certain that the doll that I raised, Efa, would be leaving me for a faraway place.
 
 v21cr0426
 クリス「(―No, I never did raise Efa.)」
 Efa came to me as no one else but herself.
 ...And now, at last.
 It was time for the finale, which Coco had been so afraid of.
 v21cr0427
 クリス「...If so, then please kill me.」
 Faced with the Angel, who had declared that she would never leave the one who had raised her, the queen spoke those horrible words through my mouth.
 
 v22ef0346
 エファ「―I understand.」
 And then, the Angel took a dagger hanging off the wall.
 black450
 Following her orders, she pushed the queen down and straddled her―
 ev904a
 Her hands gripping the dagger, its tip pointed at her mistress's chest, she ceased to move. 
 v21cr0428
 クリス「Come, think of nothing but to stab me.」
 The queen said that, believing that she would surely not be able to do it.
 v22ef0347
 エファ「―I cannot do that.」
 v21cr0429
 クリス「Why is that? Did you not say that you understood just now?」
 
 Seeing that it turned out as she had expected, the queen strengthened her words against the troubled Angel.
 v21cr0430
 クリス「Come, stab me with...」
 v22ef0348
 エファ「I cannot.」
 Rather than celebrating her victory over the sorrowful Angel,
 v21cr0431
 クリス「Do you not desire freedom?」
 she whispered those sweet temptations instead.
 v22ef0349
 エファ「But that...」
 v21cr0432
 クリス「Do you not wish to live as a human?」
 v22ef0350
 エファ「Dolls can never become human.」
 That was a obvious fact. Dolls are dolls because they are different than humans.
 And that was the fact which was binding the Angel from leaving the Queen.
 v21cr0433
 クリス「If I tell you that if you kill me, you could become human... then what would you do?」
 
 ...However.
 v22ef0351
 エファ「...I...」
 v21cr0434
 クリス「Don't you want to become human? The one who said to me that they wished to be human... that was you, was it not?」
 
 No longer able to control her own feelings, the Queen continued her temptation of the Angel.
 v22ef0352
 エファ「...That's...」
 v21cr0435
 クリス「Are you disobeying my order?」
 v22ef0353
 エファ「...If that is truly your order...」
 v21cr0436
 クリス「Then, obey my order. Oh Angel, come, kill me, grasp your freedom with your own hands, and fly with your wings spread.」
 ―You can't do it, right?
 The reason you can never do it, is because you are a doll... you are my doll, my Angel, and mine alone.
 black450
 I shall not let you leave me.
 That is why you should have just stayed as an Angel's Egg.
 That way, you never would have become this wise―

 クリス「(―So the play has already reached this stage, eh?)」
 I felt truly glad that I had been able to so immerse myself into my role that I had forgotten myself until now.
 I don't know how I did it myself,
 but the play had already reached its climax.
 v21cr0439
 クリス「(―Now, with my final line...)」
 ―Oh Angel, I love you from the bottom of my heart.
 Those were not words with the intent of gauging the Angel's determination, but rather words from the depths of the queen's heart.
 Upon hearing that, the Angel will then realize how weak the Queen's heart had been―

 How much time has passed?
 Had it just been an instant?
 Or had I been spacing out?

 v22ef0354
 エファ「...Y-Your... Your, Highness?」
 Using the hilt of the dagger to hide her own mouth from the audience noticing, she murmured a cue to me.
 
 But even if she prompted me... at this moment, I―
 v21cr0441
 クリス「(―Aah, why can I not... say that final line?)」
 Whether I was alone, or whether Coco and Efa was watching me as we practiced, I could never say that line.
 
 v21cr0442
 クリス「(―Why? Why can't I...)」
 
 Why is it that ‘I love you’ is such a difficult thing to say?

 ...Anyone, anyone at all... Please―

 v22ef0356
 エファ「Even, if, it is... to―」
 v21cr0446
 クリス「(―Efa...!)」
 With her face in agony, she spoke those lines that weren't in the script, seemingly with the intent of trying to cover up for me.
 
 But I had no idea why Efa looked as if she was suffering so.
 I was not one to judge, I myself could not say that final line either―
 black450
 Feeling miserable for myself, I couldn't meet Efa's eyes, and avoided her stare by glancing into the audience.
 sv909a
 And then, at that moment, for some reason―
 My sight was attracted to the Blue Ambassador, Valery.
 black450

 He, and only he, wore an expression different from the rest of the audience.

 It was not an expression of unease or shock, nor was it doubt.

 How did I come to be here? I did not know, but I recognized well the place within the castle grounds where I now stood.
 
 v21cr0461
 クリス「...The courtyard...?」

 A place filled with the songs of birds and the rustle of trees swaying in the breeze.
 I knew this place well, since I had lived in the Dornstein Castle ever since the day I was born.
 
 Though I had not yet tried, I was sure that I could find my way back to my chamber with my eyes closed.

 And then I realized it. I was dreaming.
 
 
 When I realized the true nature of the world I was in, the fancy that I can do as I wish within this place until I wake up arose inside my mind. 
 
 ...I could summon whoever I want, and command the scenery around me however I please.

 But can I really become a queen that everyone will acknowledge!? 
 v21cr0500

 What is it that I had wished for?
 What is it that I had desired from all this? ...When I asked myself that, I had no answer.

 The Princess gazed straight at me, the same way as that time when we were playing hide and seek in the courtyard.

 And then, she placed her hands on my shoulders, and smiled.

 As if she were imitating me, the princess suddenly stopped moving.

 When she did that, I saw those glittering tears flow from her eyes.

 You mustn't, you mustn't!」
 I swiftly used my gloves to cover the Princess's eyes.

 ...Is it fine now?
 chr_b02
 v21cr0566
 クリス「Yes, I can. I can see you clearly now.」
 The Princess gave me a small smile.
 But then, she held my hands―

 ココ「Awawa?
 Whyー?」
 Why did she close the gaps of my fingers and hide her face behind them again?
 v21cr0567
 クリス「Please just listen to me this way.」
 v02co0900

 I couldn't see her face... I could only hear her voice.
 v21cr0568
 クリス「Coco, do you... remember the play?」
 v02co0901
 ココ「Yup yup, I remember. Practice― practice―」
 I remember the times I practiced lots and lots of lines in the courtyard with the Princess and Efa.

 As I raised my hands up in shock, I saw the Princess's face.
 v02co0903
 ココ「Why―?
 Why―?」
 It was fun, so I wanted to know why we were going to stop.
 v21cr0571
 クリス「―That's because...」

 クリス「...I don't know. But please, for a while... just forget about the play.」

 It seemed like the Princess's voice was trembling.
 ...That's why, I mustn't say anything selfish.

 クリス「...Yes?」
 v02co0907
 ココ「It's very difficult, to forget things, right?」

 As I touched the Princess's face, I could feel that it was very warm, but for some reason... it seemed very lonely too. I wonder why?

 rmsg_a01
 v29da0001
 団長「...」
 The hesitant-looking woman I had invited into my office was none other than the head representative from the Red Kingdom.
 v24ei0403
 アイン「Or would you prefer that we discuss this somewhere more spacious?」
 
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0002
 団長「......No, this room will do.」
 After I opened the door for her, she gave me a bow, replied with a quiet voice that I could hardly hear, and slowly entered the room.
 
 rmsg_a01
 I proceeded to close the door gently, so as not to make a loud noise. The head representative remained at an unusually far distance from me.
 v24ei0404
 アイン「(―So she's the shy type, eh?)」
 The group of representatives she had brought with her... all of them wore a robe with a hood.
 It was a strong indication that they had come from the Red Kingdom. You can easily recognize that, even if looking from afar.
 v29da0003
 団長「Is this your office, may I ask, Lord Ein?」
 v24ei0405
 アイン「...Yes.」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0004
 団長「Forgive my rudeness, but I would have imagined it to be more luxurious.」
 The head representative spread her hood to see more broadly, and looked carefully about my office.
 Usually this room did not receive any foreign dignitaries, so I had arranged my furniture and possessions with my own preference foremost in mind.
 Among them, a few decorations that I have taken a liking to.
 
 
 v24ei0406
 アイン「―My apologies, if only the guest room were available for use.」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0005
 団長「Please do not worry. It is my fault for requesting a meeting with you so suddenly.」
 v24ei0407
 アイン「...I understand. Then please, have a seat over there.」
 After my guest had taken her seat, I too sat down on mine.
 And then, just as I was thinking about how I should open the conversation― 
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0006
 団長「I have a request before we begin. I would hope that what we are about to speak of... will not, in turn, be spoken of to any others.」
 
  she first asked me for a compromise.
 v24ei0408
 アイン「But of course.」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0007
 団長「Please speak of it to no one but yourself, and if possible, keep it from Princess Christina too.」
 v24ei0409
 アイン「―I would understand that, even if you did not remind me.」
 In these past few days, the Princess has devoted her full attention and concentration on the tuning of Efa, who had lost one of her wings in the rehearsal of the memorial ceremony.
 
 If I had not asked Dua to check on her on a fixed basis, the princess would become so focused on her tuning that she would forget to eat and sleep.
 
 With the princess as she was, I could not bear to speak to her of other matters and increase her mental burden.
 
 v24ei0410
 アイン「(―No, she wishes me to not mention it to anyone other than the Princess as well, eh?)」
 This woman sitting in front of me right now had purposely requested that we speak in private. By that, I could already deduce what matter she intended to discuss.
 
 rmsg_a01

 団長「―Well, Lord Ein, would you mind if I start?」
 v24ei0411

 v29da0010
 団長「Needless to say, though that barbarian who attacked Princess Christina was amongst the group of representatives that I brought, that person wasn't from our kingdom.」

 rmsg_a02
 v29da0013

 I could only present a wry smile in response to her confident reply.

 v24ei0416

 I rebuffed those threatening words she threw at me.
 v24ei0417
 アイン「If there is no evidence to indicate otherwise, then―」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0016
 団長「Are you suspecting us without any evidence, Lord Ein?」
 v24ei0418
 アイン「That is a different matter. There will be no answers to be found if we do not investigate.」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0017
 団長「―So there will be no problems if there is an investigation?」
 v24ei0419
 アイン「Whether there are problems or not will become clear AFTER the investigation.」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0018
 団長「I understand. Then we, as the representatives from the Red Kingdom, shall submit official documents to initiate our investigation so that we may be cleared of suspicion.」
 v24ei0420
 アイン「Please wait.」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0019
 団長「Is something else the matter?」
 v24ei0421
 アイン「I would like to request access to the documents related to the investigations.」
 
 v29da0020
 団長「If it's only that, of cour―」
 v24ei0422
 アイン「...Yet still, an investigation performed by your kingdom will not be enough.」
 
 
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0021
 団長「...」
 v24ei0423
 アイン「We shall initiate our own investigation, and after comparing it with yours... one answer shall prevail.」
 v29da0022
 団長「Are you unable to trust our own report?」
 We're just going around in circles like this. Does she not want to make any progress? I held back a sigh.
 
 v24ei0424
 アイン「At the very least, this incident happened within the White Kingdom, so legally speaking, we have the right to perform an investigation.」
 
 
 
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0023
 団長「Then I, as the representative of the Red Kingdom, shall exercise my privilege as a diplomat to veto that.」
 v24ei0425
 アイン「―Is that so?」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0024
 団長「Yes.」
 The head representative adhered firmly to the principle of her inviolability. Still, that voice of hers... it possessed not dignity, but nervousness.
 
 v24ei0426
 アイン「(―How pitiful...)」
 I felt rather sorry for the representative for the pressure upon her.
 
 
 I had heard that she had been appointed as this visit's head representative due to her talents as a tuner, with complete disregard towards the Red Kingdom's usual practice of placing high importance on hierarchy.
 
 
 The reason for her persistence in rejecting any interference in the Red Kingdom's affairs must have been an order from the real diplomats. 
 
 
 
 v24ei0427
 アイン「I understand, I shall not pursue matters any further regarding the representatives from the Red Kingdom.」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0025
 団長「―I am grateful that we have come to an understanding.」
 v24ei0428
 アイン「Well then, may I speak of our own affairs?」
 v29da0026
 団長「Yes.」
 v24ei0429
 アイン「This regards the investigation of the barbarian that attempted to assassinate the White Kingdom's ruler, Princess Christina.」
 
 
 
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0027
 団長「...Those are...」
 v24ei0430
 アイン「These documents are from the coroner.」
 Though the guards had captured the man who attempted to attack the princess and thrown him into a cell, he did not confess anything under our interrogation.
 
 And after a few hours, he was suddenly found dead with his hands clutched about his throat.
 v24ei0431

 団長「T-then, what is with that investigation report...」
 v24ei0435
 アイン「By that, I was referring to our suspicion of your delegation.」
 v24ei0436
 アイン「And not long ago, you informed me that the person whom this investigation report concerns had nothing to do with the representatives of the Red Kingdom.」 
 
 
 
 v24ei0437
 アイン「So there should not be any problem with this investigation.」
 rmsg_a03

 I fixed my stare upon her intently and waited for her response.
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0033
 団長「...Kuh...」
 v24ei0440

 Even if she were to break down and cry, I would still not back down.
 rmsg_a03

 アイン「You have my utmost gratitude.」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0039
 団長「―B-but! I would have you know this is of my own personal discretion, for the sake of clearing your suspicions of our kingdom, rather than my duty as a representative―」

 And so, I was finally able to start the meeting with the representative of the Red Kingdom.
 
 
 When she discovered details in the report I had given her to look through that cast the Red Kingdom in an unfavorable light, she requested that I have them reinvestigated.

 団長「Weren't our identities confirmed by the guards of all three kingdoms, with the White Kingdom in command, at the time we entered the hall?」

 アイン「―Yes, it would be impossible for him to infiltrate the group at that point.」
 v29da0044
 団長「...Then when did he?」
 v24ei0449
 アイン「During the intermission.」
 
 
 v29da0045
 団長「Eh?」
 v24ei0450
 アイン「When the representatives left from their seats during that period of time, the assassin predicted the time of their return―」
 
 
 
 v24ei0451
 アイン「And then slipped in with them, wearing a red robe.」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0046
 団長「...How could that have...」
 Dressed as he was, even if his gender could have been identified by his tall build, it would be hard to recognize his face with the hood over his eyes.
 
 As those returning were all assumed to be people who had passed the security check before entering the hall, it is possible that the guards were lax and let them through without checking again. 
 
 That logic applied to all of the guests, regardless which kingdom they were from.
 
 
 v24ei0452
 アイン「(―No, isn't that reasoning a bit too hasty?)」
 It is possible that there is a traitor among us, too.
 v29da0047
 団長「So, what is the identity of this person who deceived we of Cardinal?」
 
 
 
 
 v24ei0453

 rmsg_a02
 v29da0048
 団長「D-didn't I said earlier that we did not―」
 v24ei0454

 Everything must be the doing of the Red Kingdom! ...I mustn't say anything that implies that conclusion.

 For a moment, I was unsure how to answer her questions. But I judged that there was no need to lie to her, and so told her the truth.

 Rather than her, the most suspicious person... was without a doubt the Blue Ambassador, Valery.

 As I looked at the head representative in front of me, a plan sprung to my mind.
 But before I decide whether or not I should initiate this plan, I have to wait for Dua's supplementary report.

 I have a mountainous pile of questions to ask that person regarding the rehearsal incident.

 To avoid suspicion, I had refrained from meeting with him at the ambassadorial mansion at the city, and waited for so long for a chance to be able to speak with him naturally within the castle.
 
 Now that I've called to him, will Lord Valery avoid me and head elsewhere?

 Now that the plan had failed, I did not know who to trust anymore.
 What should I do if, by any chance, Lord Valery would have nothing to do with me?
 
 If I were to be suspected, there's no way I could just defend myself by insisting I didn't know anything.
 
 However, if I testified that it was Lord Valery who was the mastermind, it would lessen my punishment.
 ...No, that wouldn't work. If he were to return back to his kingdom, the law of the Blue Kingdom will be on his side and his rights as a foreign officer will render him immune from being charged by the White Kingdom.

 ―It had been five days since that incident.
 Though the Dornstein Castle had finally calmed down from the incident, it was more somber than usual.
 
 However, there was an increase in the guards placements from the castle gate to the courtyard, and the tense atmosphere from the incident had not disappear.

 ヴァレ「Hiding ourselves ineptly will only attract suspicion. Let's talk openly, shall we?」
 I could only stare in silence as Lord Valery continued to walk.

 After arriving at a spot distant enough to observe the entire keep in a single glance, he stopped―
 val_b03
 v26va0183
 ヴァレ「We won't have to worry about anyone eavesdropping if we talk here.」
  and smiled to me.
 v27ha0313
 ハンス「(―But we won't be able to tell if someone is watching us from somewhere...)」
 Still, I understood that not being overheard was much more important than not being seen.
 A suspect is just a suspect. without any evidence, there is always a way out.
 val_b05
 v26va0184
 ヴァレ「So, what do you want to talk about?」
 v27ha0314
 ハンス「―O-oh.」
 As the sudden target of his cold stare, I was suddenly at a loss how to ask him.
 No matter what I ask, isn't it all meaningless anyway? A feeling of defeat rose up within me.
 
 v26va0185
 ヴァレ「Is there anything the matter?」
 But if I back down right now, I'll be going back to those sleepless nights again.
 Compared to that, strengthening my resolve and asking him straight out is a hundred times easier.
 v27ha0315
 ハンス「W-what I wished to ask concerns the finale of the play― wasn't Efa going to bring Princess Christina to the backstage, then our people waiting there would take her out of the kingdom?」

 val_b02
 v26va0187
 ヴァレ「So?」
 v27ha0317
 ハンス「―W-what do you mean ‘so...’」
 ...The conversation stopped.
 I had expected him to answer my question, so I couldn't find the words to continue.
 
 val_b08
 v26va0188
 ヴァレ「It seems that you have misunderstood, Lord Hans.」
 v27ha0318
 ハンス「...M-misunderstood...?」
 If that were really true, then how relieved I would be. Rather, it would be better if all of this had never happened to begin with.
 
 
 
 val_b01
 v26va0189
 ヴァレ「Hmm, must I really tell you everything?」
 v27ha0319
 ハンス「N-n...」
 The way he asked that was as if he were judging me, and for a moment I wanted to refuse, but―
 v27ha0320
 ハンス「I-if possible, I would like to know everything.」
 Not this time. I'm not going to back down without knowing anything at all.
 val_b02

 ヴァレ「Very well. As a fellow comrade, you have the right to know... but.」

 Why the hell is he saying something that obvious at this time? I was too exhausted to become angry.

 ヴァレ「My, my. This is your bad habit, Hans.」
 v27ha0323
 ハンス「Eh?」
 val_b01
 v26va0193
 ヴァレ「...Your thoughts are showing on your face. A thread inside you snapped just now, did it not?」
 
 Yes, and you're the person who caused it! ...Though I wanted to shout that, I had no energy remaining to do so.
 
 v26va0194
 ヴァレ「...Do you really think it's okay, Lord Hans? You're wise, and because you're wise, you always think. I would not criticize such a thing, but―」

 ハンス「...I understand. I shall do my best.」
 v26va0197
 ヴァレ「That's right. If you frown a bit like right now, it makes it hard for people to read your thoughts.」
 He laughed in solitary amusement, then straightened his collar.
 val_b01
 v26va0198
 ヴァレ「Well now, let's start from the beginning to remind you of our goal.」
 v26va0199
 ヴァレ「―Initially, as you should already know, the motive of our plan was to obtain custody of Princess Christina and make everyone in the White Kingdom question Lord Ein's standing.」
 
 
 
 
 v27ha0325
 ハンス「Yes.」
 In other words, it was a simple plan to kidnap the princess and engineer the downfall of the steward.
 v26va0200
 ヴァレ「Now, there are several problems with this plan, and the most important one along them was - ‘to clear ourselves of suspicion.’」
 
 
 val_b08
 v26va0201
 ヴァレ「Well, to put it bluntly... I am the ambassador of the Blue Kingdom. In my position I can more or less elude any suspicion, is that right?」
 
 
 
 v27ha0326
 ハンス「―Y-yes.」
 val_b01
 v26va0202
 ヴァレ「But, that does not apply to you and... our late comrade Lord Jussi, as you two are both from the White Kingdom.」
 
 
 
 v26va0203
 ヴァレ「...Thus, our answer to that was simple. We just have to shift the attention to people more suspicious than us.」
 
 v27ha0327
 ハンス「―People more suspicious than us.」
 val_b08
 v26va0204
 ヴァレ「Yes, merely turn suspicion upon the Red Kingdom.」
 
 
 v26va0205
 ヴァレ「With that intent, I searched for any possible motives from Cardinal, and as a result― we actually didn't even need to do an ounce of preparation.」
 
 
 
 v27ha0328
 ハンス「...What do you mean by that?」
 val_b01
 v26va0206
 ヴァレ「For the upcoming memorial ceremony, Cardinal too had a number of plans in store.」
 
 val_b02
 v26va0207
 ヴァレ「Did you seriously expect that we were the only ones plotting, Lord Hans?」
 
 v27ha0329
 ハンス「N-no.」
 I was displeased by the patronizing manner in which he spoke to me, but I couldn't retort, since I had no basis to deny his claim.
 
 In fact, I even knew that there had been suspicious movements amongst the group of representatives from the Red Kingdom.
 
 val_b03
 v26va0208
 ヴァレ「―Huhuhu, it seems that even among the peace-loving, God-fearing people of Cardinal, there are a few radicals.」
 
 
 
 v26va0209
 ヴァレ「Rather than attempting to persuade the slow-acting conservatives of their viewpoint, they have joined forces with those that share even a fragment of their aspirations―」
 
 v26va0210
 ヴァレ「And have gradually started moving beneath the calm waters.」
 v27ha0330
 ハンス「...Lord Valery, since when have you known that?」
 val_b01
 v26va0211
 ヴァレ「To make it brief, I've known about it for quite some time already.」
 v27ha0331
 ハンス「And from where is the information?」
 val_b02
 v26va0212
 ヴァレ「―Let's just say that one of my agents in Cardinal told me.」
 
 
 From the way he said that, he's probably hiding something from me.
 val_b01
 v26va0213
 ヴァレ「The goal of the radicals is quite similar to ours. What they want is the epitome of the Doll Arts - the ‘Dorn's Memory’.」
 
 v27ha0332
 ハンス「...Memory?」
 Unable to grasp his meaning, I repeated that single word.
 black450
 v27ha0333
 ハンス「(―Could it be that Lord Valery has discovered the greatest secret of the Doll Arts, passed down from generation to generation by the royalty of the Weiss...)」
 
 v26va0214
 ヴァレ「Oh? Did you not know of the Dorn family's secret, Lord Hans?」
 
 v27ha0334
 ハンス「What are you talking about?」
 Fearing the possibility that he was trying to trick me into revealing it, I tried my best not to let my thoughts show on my face.
 ...But.
 bg52b01
 val_b04
 v26va0215
 ヴァレ「Are you hiding things from me, your comrade?」
 Suddenly, he stopped testing me and shot those sharp words straight at me.
 val_b02
 v26va0216
 ヴァレ「―Oh, you're doing quite well, that's more like it.」
 Saying that, Valery patted my shoulders, and all of a sudden without the slightest hesitation, 
 v26va0217
 ヴァレ「Please keep that up. The proficiency in the Doll Arts among the descendants of the Dorn family was all thanks to that gem that was passed down generation to generation.」
 he spoke the core of the secret.
 
 v27ha0335
 ハンス「How did you know of that secret... Lord Valery?」
 v26va0218
 ヴァレ「How many years do you think has passed since the creation of this kingdom? There's no way they could hide it forever. It's more of an open secret already.」
 
 
 After he told me that, I realized how limited my outlook was.
 
 Even after being sent to the Blue Kingdom as an ambassador, in the end I was still a frog dwelling in a well, unaware of the vast ocean.
 
 
 val_b01
 v26va0219
 ヴァレ「In short, the Red desires a more advanced level of Doll Arts, and that is only natural, since the Red Kingdom is where the Doll Arts originate from.」
 
 
 
 v26va0220
 ヴァレ「It is no joy to them, the place of its origin, for a smaller and younger kingdom to be superior to them in terms of Doll Arts.」
 
 
 
 v27ha0336
 ハンス「...How selfish.」
 It was just like an adult snatching a toy away from their child as punishment for their insolence in growing up.
 
 
 val_b02
 v26va0221
 ヴァレ「Yes, to be selfish is magnificent. Cardinal is so, as are we. We all are not satisfied by the current status quo, that is why we want more.」
 
 v27ha0337
 ハンス「...」
 val_b01
 v26va0222
 ヴァレ「Now, how far has my explanation gotten? Up to Cardinal's plot?」
 
 v27ha0338
 ハンス「Y-yes.」
 v26va0223
 ヴァレ「Their target is, as I said earlier, the epitome of Doll Arts that Princess Christina holds - the ‘Dorn's Memory’, but...」
 
 Within the group of radicals that had joined forces, there were two separate parties.
 On one side were the conservatives that had joined forces with them―
 val_b02
 v26va0224
 ヴァレ「You could say that they are the more sensible ones.」
 Their mindset of their party is that they don't want to cause a major incident, but desire progress regardless.
 
 
 
 On the other hand, in the radical group are the extremists.
 v26va0225
 ヴァレ「They are willing to let this advance into an international affair.」
 And the consensus they have come to... was to create two plans, the sensible ‘outside’ and the radical ‘inside.’
 v26va0226
 ヴァレ「...If the ‘outside’ is successful, then all is well. But if it fails, they shall resort to force. That is their plan that will initiate in the day of the memorial ceremony.」
 
 v27ha0339
 ハンス「...What is the ‘outside’ plan?」
 val_b01
 v26va0227
 ヴァレ「To insert the ‘gem’ into Efa, and copy the memory from Princess Christina.」
 v27ha0340
 ハンス「...!」
 v26va0228
 ヴァレ「For you, who studied the Doll Arts in Blew, I'm sure you know what this means, right?」
 v27ha0341
 ハンス「Y-yes.」
 bg52b01
 During dolls' growth process, they learn of things from their surroundings just like humans do.
 ...But there was one major difference in the method they used to learn.
 Humans understand things as time passes by, but for dolls, they possess a capability much more superior to that hidden in their gems.
 
 v27ha0342
 ハンス「―Do you mean the replication capability of the Memory Stone?」
 val_b01
 v26va0229
 ヴァレ「Yes. As if they were carefully copying down the contents of a valuable book, each and every word of it exact to the original- a perfect copy.」
 
 
 
 v27ha0343
 ハンス「But that's just a theoretical phenomenon, there haven't been any real-life examples...」
 val_b08
 v26va0230
 ヴァレ「Of course there has, a perfect example, in fact. ...That is the incident that happened when Princess Christina was a child.」
 
 v27ha0344
 ハンス「What did you say!?」
 What he explained to me afterwards was an incident that I had no idea of.
 And that was only natural.
 The late king had told only a select few about the incident that happened to his daughter.
 val_b01
 v26va0231
 ヴァレ「Well, though they hid the details, when that letter of consultation was sent to an engineer in another kingdom... it was unavoidable that it would be discovered and traced, right?」
 
 v27ha0345
 ハンス「...」
 v26va0232
 ヴァレ「These long-winded tales are tiring me, let us dispense with them and return to the operation Cardinal seeks to carry out.」
 
 v26va0233
 ヴァレ「Their plan is to replicate the Dorn's Memory, and if that were to fail, they shall initiate a bold operation of bringing the bearer herself back to their kingdom.」
 
 v26va0234
 ヴァレ「Knowing that, we shall take advantage of their efforts.」
 val_b02
 v26va0235
 ヴァレ「...We'll let Cardinal carry out their plans, but in the end, we will be the ones to take the prize.」
 
 
 
 val_b01
 v26va0236
 ヴァレ「Now, Lord Hans, have I explained clearly enough?」
 v27ha0346
 ハンス「...No, I still don't understand.」
 Even I hardly believed the immediacy with which I denied that, but now that I had said it, I couldn't take it back. 
 
 What he had revealed to me up until now concerned only the Red Kingdom's plans.
 v27ha0347
 ハンス「(―What I wanted to ask about was regarding the Blue Kingdom's plan!)」
 v27ha0348
 ハンス「...There are still matters I do not yet understand yet.」

 ヴァレ「―Feel free to ask if you have any questions. If we don't banish our doubts, it will become a hindrance for us later on.」
 v27ha0349
 ハンス「Then, what I wish to ask is about the genuine dagger that Lord Jussi provided me with. What was the purpose of that?」
 
 v26va0238
 ヴァレ「Dagger? Ah, the one that Efa wielded during the play.」
 
 v27ha0350
 ハンス「...Yes.」
 Although the dagger intended for the play looked real, its edges were not sharp.
 I couldn't find the reason that he wanted to switch that with a genuine dagger.
 val_b01
 v26va0239
 ヴァレ「That is, well, insurance.」
 v27ha0351
 ハンス「Insurance?」
 v26va0240
 ヴァレ「An alternative plan in case we were to fail. You must always consider ways to succeed even after a failure- that is the meaning of tactics.」
 
 v26va0241
 ヴァレ「The presence of sharp edges on the dagger will make it appear that Efa intended to harm Princess Christina.」
 
 v27ha0352
 ハンス「...」
 val_b02
 v26va0242
 ヴァレ「―In addition...」
 v27ha0353
 ハンス「In addition?」
 v26va0243
 ヴァレ「It creates a more genuine atmosphere of tension during the finale, does it not?」
 val_b08
 v26va0244
 ヴァレ「The finale was obviously just an act of a play, but after adding our little insurance... even we who know about the script's contents can enjoy the tension in that performance, isn't that so?」
 
 v27ha0354
 ハンス「(―He's lying.)」
 Though that manner of ‘insurance’ certainly befitted Lord Valery, that was not all there was to it.
 v27ha0355
 ハンス「(―If that wasn't intended to be insurance...)」
 v27ha0356
 ハンス「...Then what about the Control Stone I had Coco place inside Efa?」
 val_b01
 v26va0245
 ヴァレ「Hm? That's just a trick to bring our ‘queen’ to the backstage. Must I explain that too?」
 
 
 
 v27ha0357
 ハンス「Y-yes, please.」
 v26va0246
 ヴァレ「If the doll that brought Princess Christina off the stage were Coco, then wouldn't our Blue Kingdom be suspected?」
 
 
 
 v26va0247
 ヴァレ「That's why, even though the preparations were troublesome, it was necessary.」
 bg52b01
 On the day of the rehearsal, I had avoided any direct interaction with Efa, and used Coco - the one who would cause the least suspicion.
 
 What I have given Coco were the two gems, one of which was to control her movements later, and a box of cookies with a sleeping drug tailored especially for Efa mixed within.
 
 Manipulated by the Control Stone, Coco took off Efa's shoe after she fell asleep from eating the cookies and inserted the other Control Stone into a hidden spot in the heel of Efa's shoe, thus completing her mission.
 
 
 ...What I wished to ask him was regarding the gem that had been inserted inside Efa.
 val_b02
 v26va0248
 ヴァレ「Efa's Control Stone is a custom-made item I obtained from the Red Kingdom. Pardon my rudeness, Lord Hans, but it may be a difficult artifact for you to understand, as you only studied doll arts for a few years.」
 
 
 v27ha0358
 ハンス「(―That is a likely enough reason, but...)」
 Why did he encrypt the orders sealed within the Control Stone?
 v27ha0359
 ハンス「(―I see, is it because it would buy time in the event it were to be discovered?)」
 ...If I asked him, he would surely answer that.
 v26va0249
 ヴァレ「...Huhuhu, a Memory Stone in her right heel and a Control Stone in her left heel. Don't you think that feels kind of balanced?」
 
 v26va0250
 ヴァレ「With those two stones inside her, there will be enough suspicion upon the Red... No, the dagger too has an important role.」
 
 v27ha0360
 ハンス「(―That's not all, is it?)」
 Lord Valery hadn't told me the most important part.
 val_b01
 v26va0251
 ヴァレ「Is there still anything bothering you?」
 v27ha0361
 ハンス「―A-about that hooded man that appeared at the final scene, he was not in our plan...」
 
 Before I even finished my question, he fixed his stare upon me, a smirk surfacing on his lips.
 
 val_b08
 v26va0252
 ヴァレ「―Was that not a ploy by the Red?」
 v27ha0362
 ハンス「...!」
 val_b01
 v26va0253

 For the first time in our conversation, those words he said carried strength, and left my body trembling in fear.
 
 There was no longer any smile within his eyes.

 From the very beginning, this man―

 ヴァレ「I cannot even imagine what would have happened to Princess Christina if Efa hadn't protected her.」
 
 had Efa wield the dagger, and commanded the hooded man―

 han_h04
 v27ha0364
 ハンス「(―There's no mistake!)」
 Denying it at first, then leading me to a conclusion... I had no doubt of my suspicion.
 The radical group from the Red wanted to capture Princess Christina- they would never have initiated an operation that would harm her. 
 
 Killing Princess Christina onstage, and letting the blame for it fall upon the Red... that is the conspiracy that he had prepared.

 15.10.18
 I received news of a death this morning.
 The former foreign minister, Lord Jussi, had suddenly passed away.
 I couldn't believe it. When I had met him the morning yesterday, not only did he look in fine health, he was even full of spirit.
 
 I was told that the cause of death had been ‘sickness.’
 I prayed that his soul would rest in peace, and took upon myself his dying wishes for the sake of the kingdom that was his home.
 
 16.10.18
 After the official declaration that Lord Jussi had passed away from sickness, some rumors arose.
 
 The most terrifying one was that he had died from a virulent plague, but the coroner had denied that from the beginning.
 
 
 If it were something as dreadful as that,
 
 they would surely plan to cremate him. ...Therefore, it is unthinkable that he had died from a contagious disease.
 Many other rumors claim that he perished not from sickness, but from...
 No, I have no need to write these down here.
 
 That will be all for today.
 17.10.18
 After the funeral, I went and inquired about Lord Jussi's demise from several servants I knew in the Osborne Mansion.
 
 Shockingly, I learned that there had been only one man at his side when he passed away. The other servants didn't even know which disease had struck him down, only that he had died in the evening.
 
 
 
 
 I was told by the head butler that the man who had stayed beside Lord Jussi in his final moments had suffered greatly from the shock of his master's death, and taken leave from the mansion to recuperate.
 
 
 
 
 It seemed that man had been Lord Jussi's carriage driver.
 
 
 Where he had gone after leaving the mansion... the head butler did not know. 
 The man had watched Lord Jussi until his last moments, but left the mansion without even attending the funeral...
 ―What does this mean?

 I must be careful upon Dornstein Castle's staircases.
 If one were to carelessly slip and fall, they would no doubt have a sprain to show for it.
 The doctor's fee for the examination would be 10 or 14.
 But it might eventually be more expensive than that.
 20.10.18
 My appetite has been decreasing recently.
 I wonder if my condition will settle down by next month?
 
 20.10.18
 Some wine is expected to arrive for the upcoming memorial ceremony.
 
 
 The person who ordered it is the Blue Ambassador, Lord Valery.
 I'll have to sign for receipt of the package, make some arrangements for it on the morning of the ceremony day and then our troubles will be over. I don't know much about wine, so I wish I could just leave these kinds of things to Lord Valery.
 
 
 
 
 23.10.18
 As the day of the rehearsal ceremony approaches, my unease has gradually been increasing.
 Will my preparations be free of any problems?
 If I have made a mistake, then our plan will evaporate into thin air.
 
 2J check, end distribution status is C1 and E1.
 Passed J to E through C, C done.
 Retrieved J from C. J in E remains as is.
 25.10.18 (re-entry)
 This is a supplement to my entries dated the 24th and 25th. 
 When I tore out a page of the diary for C, I forgot that I had written on the page already, so this entry spans two days. I was filled with regret upon realizing my mistake, as I hadn't at the time when I retrieved C's J.
 
 
 
 
 ...But fortunately, I don't remember writing anything suspicious on it. Now, my preparations are complete.
 
 
 ...All that remains is to pray that the rehearsal ceremony goes smoothly.

 ヴァレ「(―Huhuhu, just as I thought.)」
 A proposed conference between the three kingdoms.
 Ein was the one that had suggested it, and it was just what I had expected to happen.
 v26va0277
 ヴァレ「(―The ones he has summoned are I, the head representative from the Red Kingdom, Dua in her role as a witness to the rehearsal...)」
 
 
 val_d02
 v26va0278
 ヴァレ「...and finally, Hans.」
 From the White Kingdom's point of view, the head representative from the Red is probably nothing but a decoration, a prop used in order that they can call the meeting a ‘conference between the three kingdoms’. 
 
 
 ...No, she could qualify as a ‘witness from another kingdom’ in this case.
 val_d08
 v26va0279
 ヴァレ「(―If my plan is exposed, that is.)」
 If one were to place Blew and Cardinal on a scale, and weigh which of them is the more suspicious... the scale would doubtless tip towards to our side. 
 
 And that is only natural.
 Since the day our discussion had been overheard by Dua, I had definitely already been under suspicion.
 Claiming that I wanted to bring home some wine whose export was forbidden... there's no way child's play like that would fool them so easily.
 
 Indeed, I had already known it wouldn't work. That trick just lets them know I have some cards hidden.
 
 val_d02
 v26va0280
 ヴァレ「(―Undoubtedly, it created risk.)」
 But it was just for the sake of spicing up this boring game to which the outcome has been decided.
 If there were not a bit of challenge in this, I would not be able to take it seriously.
 v26va0281
 ヴァレ「(―Still, how pitiful.)」
 This weak and miniscule kingdom whose only strength is their Doll Arts, that is. Their survival depends on the mood of their progenitors, Blew and Cardinal, and they must constantly negotiate their continued existence.
 
 They cannot take sides, nor can they escape their influence.
 If they grow too close to one kingdom, it will definitely damage the relationship with the other.
 val_d08
 v26va0282
 ヴァレ「(―As if resting upon a bed of needles.)」
 To maintain this balance of power throughout the generations, Weiss has always avoided royal marriages with the Red and Blue, and picked their consorts from their own kingdom, but―
 
 
 
 
 
 The late king's queen had died of illness several years after giving birth to their only child, Christina.
 Some time after the period of mourning had ended, both the Blue and the Red had proposed candidates from their own kingdoms to be the king's next consort.
 
 val_d01
 v26va0283
 ヴァレ「(―And yet the king did as he pleased.)」
 Of course, it would be better had he quickly chosen his next spouse, but...
 val_d02
 v26va0284
 ヴァレ「（―He did not wish to be unfaithful to his late wife, or to his daughter.)」
 
 
 If that were not the case, he wouldn't have passed away without leaving a male heir to the throne.
 bg52a01
 v26va0285
 ヴァレ「How pitiful.」
 Since this kingdom has had a policy of hereditary succession since its creation, a collateral relative can never become a legitimate heir. 
 
 
 
 Thus the burden of rulership was forced onto Christina's shoulders.
 v26va0286
 ヴァレ「(―If they had been willing to accept a monarch in name alone rather than in blood, then anyone would have sufficed.)」
 But there was a hidden reason why that could never be allowed.
 v26va0287
 ヴァレ「(―And that is the inheritance of the Doll Arts.)」
 Each and every ruler of Weiss throughout the generations have had their own talents, but despite that, they were all able to master the most modern of Doll Arts that existed in their era.
 
 ...Moreover, their skills would reach the level of the previous ruler's in an exceptionally short time.
 And that is not something that can be achieved just by reading books or having an excellent teacher.
 If so, how did they accomplish that?
 The answer for that is none other than the gem that possesses the sum of the Doll Arts that have been passed down from generation to generation - the ‘Dorn's Memory’.
 
 
 v26va0288
 ヴァレ「(―The gem through which even human memories can be inherited.)」
 The Dorn family has incorporated some tricks into the ‘Dorn's Memory’ as insurance, ensuring that only their direct descendants are able to utilize it.
 
 That was as if a curse tailored especially for the Blue and Red Kingdom.
 
 
 v26va0289
 ヴァレ「(―They didn't want to surrender the essence of their Doll Arts to either side.)」
 Even if the Red or Blue were to obtain it by force, they still would not be able to witness its contents... it would be nothing more than an ordinary stone.
 
 Nobody would be pleased at acquiring a worthless stone.
 val_d05
 v26va0290
 ヴァレ「Since it requires the most rare of keys to unlock. ...Arts that can only be inherited through one's bloodline, what a pitiful fate awaits the descendents of Dorn.」
 
 Just because she possess the blood of Dorn, she will be forced to succeed the throne... a deplorable situation. 
 As a foreign officer from a neighboring kingdom, I believed things would be easier if she were to quickly find a consort.
 val_d02
 v26va0291
 ヴァレ「(―Right, Ein?)」
 Could it be that it was hard for that steward to make himself a candidate due to his youth? Or could it be...
 
 v26va0292
 ヴァレ「(―That he's waiting for an appropriate time to become monarch himself?)」
 Rebellion from within requires quite some preparation, and Ein is certainly of noble enough blood to make himself king.
 
 Even if the steward that has always supported the Princess behind her were to step forward and stand beside her in status, the one in charge of diplomacy with the other kingdoms will not change.
 
 v26va0293
 ヴァレ「(―That's interesting in its own way.)」
 One of excellence such as yours would be fit to lead this nation, is that not so?
 To cross the swords of diplomacy with a Weiss ruled by Ein would be quite welcome.
 val_d03
 v26va0294
 ヴァレ「...But, but, b-u-t.」
 That will never happen.
 v26va0295
 ヴァレ「(―Too bad, Ein.)」
 ...The preparations are already complete.
 You can suspect the Blue Kingdom as much as you want- without evidence, it is futile.
 
 
 val_d02
 v26va0296
 ヴァレ「This is a fine day for the conspiracy to be unmasked.」
 
 First, it was Cardinal who inserted the Memory Stone inside Efa's shoe.
 Second, they added a Control Stone in order to do away with Christina.
 And third, they sent a robed assassin just to be sure.
 black450
 v26va0297
 ヴァレ「...The suspicion of our Blue Kingdom shall be cleansed by the blood of your people.」
 
 
 Everything will be Cardinal's doing, and all will be settled by that. 
 
 
 This meeting of the three kingdoms that Ein has arranged―

 v22ef0359
 エファ「...I have slept well, thank you.」
 It was as if those words of hers had lifted a weight from my chest.
 Since the day of that incident, I had not left her side and had been constantly looking after her... and finally, I was able to see her usual expression again.

 As she said that, I saw Efa reach behind her back and realized what she was thinking about.
 K_BGM11b
 v21cr0582
 クリス「Is it because you lost your angel's wing?」
 v22ef0365
 エファ「...Yes.」
 Those words stabbed through my chest.
 Rather than feeling sadness at Efa's lost wing, I was more struck by the fact that she would not be performing anymore because of it.
 
 I couldn't bring myself to speak of the incident where she had protected me when I was unable to run, and stood facing an armed assassin as her body trembled.
 
 black450
 v21cr0583
 クリス「(―Efa...)」
 If I mention that incident, we will just be torturing ourselves by bringing up a memory we wish only to forget.
 But forgetting would be wrong.
 If I remain quiet, I will become one who forever relies on others.
 
 I shall not become the kind of person who would acknowledge one who was injured for my sake with nothing but silence.
 v21cr0584
 クリス「(―But what should I say to her?)」
 Should I express my gratitude?
 Or should I apologize?
 What can people say at this kind of time that others will understand?
 I despised myself for not knowing the answer.
 v21cr0585
 クリス「(―But still...)」
 Even if I couldn't express myself properly,
 I must tell Efa how I feel―

 At the sight of me stammering and on the verge of tears, Efa tried to stand and hurry to my side, but she could not keep her balance.

 Somehow, I managed to give her my hand just in time to keep her from falling.

 efa_h04
 v22ef0371
 エファ「Ah, er... I-I'm sorry.」
 For some reason, Efa's body felt light in my arms.
 When I had tuned her before going on stage, I remembered her being heavier―
 bg59a01
 v21cr0593
 クリス「(―Oh, is it because she lost her wing?)」
 Or is it because she hasn't been eating well?
 Whichever reason it is, I have to take full responsibility for this.
 Even if I had been unable to move, the fact was that I had watched Efa get injured without doing anything.
 
 No matter what excuses can be made―
 v21cr0594
 クリス「I was the one at fault.」
 efa_f05
 v22ef0372
 エファ「...Eh?」
 v21cr0595

 If that were true, then my spirits should have lifted.
 But in fact, the opposite happened. I felt more upset than before.

 I am a tuner, after all. I can understand the pain Efa must have felt from trying to force herself to say something that she has difficulty saying.

 Why are you laughing, did something happen?」

 v21cr0618
 クリス「Coco is the same as usual. She's waiting earnestly in her room for you to return there.」

 As she blinked her eyes, I noticed that they were moist with withheld tears.
 v22ef0398
 エファ「...Your Highness. Please, stay beside me... a little longer...」
 v21cr0619
 クリス「What are you saying? I'll be by your side forever.」
 I held onto her hand gently while stroking her head, and after a time, I heard the calm rhythm of her breathing as she slept.
 
 Watching her peacefully sleeping face, I gently sat by the bedside, making as little noise as possible.

 I had known that speaking of that matter would make her sad.
 It was as if I were a spoiled child causing mischief just for the sake of seeing people's troubled reactions.
 
 If she were to deny that it was my fault, it was only because she knew how weak I was, and wanted to set my thoughts right.

 ハンス「...Where are you, Lord Valery?」
 han_h06
 I was summoned for the conference between the three kingdoms.
 I would have liked to ask him about matters I should be careful of before attending it, but―
 
 han_h01
 v27ha0385
 ハンス「...I can't find him anywhere.」
 So as not to interact with him within the castle grounds, I decided to wait outside the gate for him- thus the reason I stationed myself in such a secluded place. 
 
 But the scheduled time was near and I still hadn't seen Lord Valery's carriage arrive.
 After asking the gate guard out of anxiety, I found out that he had already gone inside around an hour ago.
 
 Isn't that as if he arrived without the knowledge that the time of the conference had changed!?
 
 If he really hadn't known about the change, I would have sent a messenger to inform him... as I thought of that, a single concern arose inside my head.
 
 han_h06
 v27ha0386
 ハンス「(―Could it be that I'm the one who got the time wrong?)」
 Immediately, I opened my notebook and consulted the schedule written in it. 
 As I thought, I had recorded there the message from Lord Ein's messenger regarding the delay of the conference by an hour, and even double-checked it before I left my home.
 
 v27ha0387
 ハンス「(―If I'd knew this would have happen, I should have come to the castle at the originally set time.)」
 ...On second thought, if I had arrived earlier, I would have felt uncomfortable from the nervousness and my stomach would have inevitably acted up again.
 
 black450
 v27ha0388
 ハンス「―I have no choice. It's about time I should go.」
 Bg52b02
 Actually, in regards to our approach to the conference, we already decided that a few days ago.
 During it, I will keep my mouth shut and leave all the talking to Lord Valery.
 Bg52a02
 If there comes a time where I must speak, then I would wait for his support.
 As long as I follow these two main points, they won't be able to do anything to us.
 ...I believed those words he said to me, and intended to follow them during the meeting.
 Bg56A02
 v27ha0389
 ハンス「Now, if I remember correctly, the meeting was to be held not in the office... but in the dining hall.」
 After having almost headed in the direction of the office, I recalled the correct destination and shifted my course in the opposite direction.
 It would be appropriate for the time if the meeting were to be held over dinner.
 v27ha0390
 ハンス「(―Still, despite that...)」
 Why is the castle so quiet?
 It is as if there were nobody living in it―
 v27ha0391
 ハンス「(―Hm?)」

 I noticed someone standing further down the hallway, dim with twilight.
 ...And that someone was not the person I was looking for.

 The low tone of Dua's voice made chills run through my spine.

 The saber hanging from her waist, normally silent and still, made an ominous click.
 v27ha0402
 ハンス「W-wait, wait. It's almost time for the conference. We can't be late, can we?」
 The path to the dining hall was just behind me.
 It was not as if Dua was blocking my path. I could easily turn around and head to the meeting area. 
 
 v27ha0403
 ハンス「If you have something to ask, I'll answer it later. What's important now is...」

 v27ha0417

 For a moment, I was shocked by what she said, but after further thought―
 v27ha0418
 ハンス「...Fu, fuhahaha!」
 Indeed, indeed!
 The reason she decided to interrogate me must have been from some kind of misunderstanding.
 v27ha0419
 ハンス「...Dua. Are you talking about that matter in the past?」
 v25du0423
 デュア「...Yes.」
 v27ha0420
 ハンス「The matter of Lord Valery wanting to bring back the local wine whose export is prohibited, right?」

 Though I'm terrible at lying, what I'm about to say is the truth and nothing suspicious, so I need not be afraid.

 Before I could finish denying that I hadn't received any wine from Lord Jussi, Dua interrupted me.

 v27ha0426

 v25du0430
 デュア「...Now that you have, I can convict you with complete confidence.」
 v27ha0427
 ハンス「―What are you talking about? I just swore upon that sword...」

 black450

 The paper Dua had dropped made its way to my feet with a fluttering dance.
 As I focused my eyes upon it... I saw it was a blueprint of the dagger that Efa had used onstage!

 sv992b

 v25du0434

 v25du0436

 Lord Valery had drunk from it before, so I need not be cautious of its contents.

 After he finished, I went out of the room to the hallway with him.

 v27ha0482

 Bg56A02
 After sending the signal to his servants, Lord Valery turned around and dashed away.
 While I headed for the back door, leading by the two servants.
 black450
 Has he already started pulling the strings? There was not a single guard in sight on our way.
 And then, the servants pointed towards an old, worn-out carriage filled with old clothes and garbage, then told me to hide inside the pile.
 
 
 
 v27ha0483
 ハンス「I-I understand.」
 SE32a
 After getting in, the carriage finally started moving with the creaking of old wood as it advanced.
 ...At the inspection area at the back gate, I didn't hear the voice of even a single guard, which must mean there aren't any.
 
 v27ha0484
 ハンス「(―So I've escaped...)」
 Seeing the light of dusk leak in from a gap from the mountain of old clothes I was hidden in, I realized that I had already left the castle, just as he had promised. 
 
 v27ha0485
 ハンス「...P-phew...」
 Having thought my death certain, I can hardly even believe that I had been able to survive.
 
 But still, here I was. Though I had had to endure an unpleasant odor, I had successfully escaped from the Dornstein Castle.
 
 v27ha0486
 ハンス「(―Farewell, my mother kingdom.)」
 I would probably be gone from this kingdom by tomorrow or the day after.
 Not knowing when I would be able to return, I felt a sudden feeling of loneliness rushed up me.

 ハンス「(―So I'm no match for a person such as Lord Ein after all.)」
 I'd admired him, envied him, and wanted to bring him down... and this was the result.
 
 Even I couldn't feel pity for myself.
 v27ha0488
 ハンス「(―I guess my name will be recorded as that of a traitor.)」
 But even so, I did not mind... for now, survival is my top priority.
 I shall start a fresh life in the Blue Kingdom, and will most likely never be able to return to this kingdom.
 v27ha0489

 If there is such a day, I hope that I can do something for its sake―

 v24ei0466
 アイン「(―I never thought that this would last two days...)」
 The conference between the three kingdoms, that is. I hadn't expected to sit down in this office and hold it again the day after.
 And those in attendance were the same as well - the head representative from the Red, and the Blue Ambassador.
 Just like yesterday, Dua did not attend.
 black450
 But there was one more person who would definitely not be coming.
 ein_d06
 v24ei0467
 アイン「(―Hans.)」
 I had announced that this conference would concern the assassination attempt on Princess Christina during the rehearsal for the memorial ceremony... a discussion of the true identity of the hooded man.
 But in truth, our true purpose was to uncover the mastermind who had planned the incident. 
 ein_d07
 v24ei0468
 アイン「(―I have no evidence, but I know the one pulling the strings is Valery.)」
 The Blue Ambassador is a cautious man who leaves few traces of his handiwork- thus I could only investigate Hans and Jussi.
 I had discovered that the dagger Efa had used on stage had been tampered with.
 Fortunately, I was able to obtain evidence of that, but―
 ein_d06
 v24ei0469
 アイン「(―I was too careless in the end.)」
 Yesterday evening, Hans had escaped from Dua's interrogation in the hallway near the dining hall.
 The gate guards had not seen him leave the castle- thus we searched every single corner, but he was nowhere to be found. 
 I had sent some guards to Hans' home just in case, and found that he hadn't gone back there either.
 When it grew late, the search became difficult, so I called a halt to it and intended to continue it today.
 ...However.
 This morning, I received a report from a servant in Hans' home, informing me that his master was found lying down in the living room and soon confirmed to be dead.
 ein_d07
 v24ei0470
 アイン「(―Now I've no one to extract information from...)」
 According to the coroner, there was evidence that Hans had been clutching his throat.
 
 It was a symptom similar to that of the poison used by the man who had attacked the Princess at the rehearsal.
 
 
 The reason why I couldn't be sure is because the coroner's report stated that these were the only two examples of such a death in our kingdom's history, so the poison's characteristics were difficult to identify. 
 
 
 bg58a01
 ein_d01
 v24ei0471
 アイン「(―To keep him quiet, was it?)」
 It was possible he had deliberately poisoned himself, but in the end, the result was the same.
 
 
 
 The mastermind in the shadows... had successfully covered his trail.
 v24ei0472
 アイン「(―In addition...)」
 The true mastermind can now claim that Hans was behind everything to buy time for his own escape.
 val_b01
 v26va0325
 ヴァレ「I confess I'm shocked as well, since I became well acquainted with Lord Hans in my own kingdom... so this was his doing, eh...」
 
 
 
 bg58a01
 The one able to lay the blame on Hans remained,
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0059
 団長「...Cardinal, too, cannot disregard that possibility.」
 
 
 ―and now another person was inclined to agree.
 bg58a01
 v24ei0473
 アイン「(―This completely backfired on me.)」
 Yesterday, after summoning the representatives for the conference, I lied to Hans that the meeting time had changed so that I could separate him from Valery.
 
 And then, taking advantage of his lack of bodyguards within the castle grounds, I sent Dua to trick him into confessing, then bring him to the conference... that was what I had planned.
 
 My own business went quite smoothly. As I had agreed upon with the head representative from the Red Kingdom, we began the conference with complete disregard for whatever Valery had to say.
 
 black450
 Still, just as things were going to the right direction, the witness that should have appeared made his escape...
 
 ein_d06
 v24ei0474
 アイン「(―Well, what's done is done...)」
 The dead cannot speak.
 They'll let Hans take the blame, then deny that their kingdoms were involved in or even knew of the plot.
 Not only Valery of Blew, but the representative from the Cardinal had also received orders from above to keep silent.
 
 ein_d01
 v24ei0475
 アイン「(―Considering her standpoint, that is only natural.)」
 As she is the official head representative from Cardinal, rather than taking my side for no reason, it's more likely that she will agree with Blew.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 black450
 Though she had been cooperative at yesterday's conference, I couldn't be sure that she was still willing to help me.
 
 bg58a01
 I could only blame my failure upon my own naivete.
 val_b01
 v26va0326
 ヴァレ「...Now, Lord Ein. There are still quite a few mysteries regarding this incident, so I do believe that the investigation will continue, but―」
 
 v26va0327
 ヴァレ「―We would like to know what measures you plan to take in the meantime.」
 
 Valery shot a glance at the Red representative, then slowly returned his eyes to me.
 There was no hint of sarcasm upon his face- he spoke as if it were the most natural thing for him as an ambassador, as if he were wearing a mask. 
 If the triumph he must be feeling at this moment were evident in his voice, that would make it easy for me... however, I cannot expect him to act so rashly. 
 bg58a01
 v24ei0476
 アイン「(―Then, what shall be our move...)」
 I know not what cards Valery still has up his sleeve. Taking any large risks would be inadvisable.
 In addition, making a move without the support of the Red representative would be like stepping into a battleground with no chance of victory.
 If I should say something careless out of exasperation, not only the Princess but even our citizens will become embroiled in this.
 I must act with caution. There is no other way.
 v24ei0477
 アイン「...First of all, Weiss shall postpone the opening of the memorial ceremony indefinitely.」
 
 
 val_b02
 v26va0328
 ヴァレ「―Hmm! May I regard that as an official statement from Weiss?」
 
 
 
 v24ei0478
 アイン「I don't mind.」
 val_b01
 v26va0329
 ヴァレ「But is it not possible Princess Christina may wish otherwise?」
 v24ei0479
 アイン「Would you be able to accept it if I said that... there is no need to seek her consent?」
 v26va0330
 ヴァレ「Of course. I shall take your word for it, Lord Ein... is the Red Kingdom okay with that as well?」
 
 
 
 v29da0060
 団長「―Yes, it is a reasonable decision.」
 v24ei0480
 アイン「I am thankful for your understanding.」
 val_b01
 v26va0331
 ヴァレ「...Then, if the memorial ceremony is to be delayed indefinitely. What shall we do, Lord Ein?」
 
 v24ei0481
 アイン「My apologies, but I must request that the foreign representatives return to their respective kingdoms for the time being.」
 
 v26va0332
 ヴァレ「―Well, I guess that is to be expected. Since the ceremony is not going to be held, there is no purpose in us staying here any longer.」
 bg58a01
 Valery reasoned, with a shake of his head,
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0061
 団長「Quite right.」
  while the head representative from the Red muttered in agreement.
 v29da0062
 団長「A-ahem.」
 After waiting for a break in the conversation, she coughed lightly to draw our attention, and said.
 v29da0063
 団長「...Then we shall immediately begin preparing to bring our national treasure Efa back with us.」
 And with haste, she stood up from her seat, as if indicating that the conference had ended.
 v24ei0482
 アイン「Please wait.」
 v29da0064
 団長「Is there something more you wish to say?」
 v24ei0483b
 アイン「...Yes. In regards to Efa, I expected you would wait until her wing has been restored―」
 v29da0065
 団長「―No, if our representatives shall be returning, then our plans have changed. If the opening of the ceremony is to be delayed, it is logical that we take her with us and repair her in Cardinal... don't you agree, Lord Ein?」
 
 
 v24ei0484
 アイン「(―I can't say anything back to that.)」
 Even I agreed that there was no need to leave Efa in Weiss for repairs alone.
 And I definitely wouldn't want any further commotion to arise, on top of that which already has.
 But still, if Efa is to go back to her own kingdom―
 I can already imagine how sad the Princess will be.
 v24ei0485
 アイン「(―Although it is my policy to not allow personal matters to interfere with national affairs, it is another matter when the Lady is concerned...)」
 
 I can't just allow Efa to leave in an instant.
 v29da0066
 団長「Lord Ein, if you have no more objections, then may I take my leave?」
 v24ei0486
 アイン「I have no more objections... but.」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0067
 団長「......?」
 v24ei0487
 アイン「Could you delay your departure briefly?」
 v29da0068
 団長「...How many hours do you need?」
 Judging from the word ‘hours,’ it seemed that she was in quite a hurry to return to her kingdom.
 v24ei0488
 アイン「Well, excluding today, about three days.」
 
 
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0069
 団長「Three days?」
 v24ei0489
 アイン「In that time, I'm thinking of preparing a farewell party for Efa―」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0070
 団長「Must a farewell party take three days?」
 v24ei0490
 アイン「...Very well, three days including today - you can leave the day after tomorrow.」
 
 
 During negotiations, the act of compromise is important.
 If I had said ‘two days later,’ straight away, I had a feeling she would include this day and say ‘We shall leave tomorrow, then,’- thus I added the phrase ‘excluding today.’
 
 
 Now I have enough time for the preparations.
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0071
 団長「―Then in the evening on the day after tomorrow, we shall retrieve Efa... is that satisfactory?」
 
 
 
 v24ei0491

 I nodded to the head representative from the Red Kingdom as she reluctantly accepted my proposal.

 val_b05
 v26va0333
 ヴァレ「―Farewell party, eh? How about our Coco, does she get one too?」
 
 
 Valery, who had been waiting until our conversation ended, asked with a displeased expression.
 v24ei0493
 アイン「―If Coco is going back to her kingdom at the same time as Efa...」
 val_b01
 v26va0334a
 ヴァレ「Oh, no, no. Regretfully, Coco is not a national treasure, so there is no need to rush her back to our kingdom.」

 But I scarcely knew where to start, thus I decided to open with the most grim of the subjects.

 He had died not after living a full life, nor from sickness, but from a mysterious casualty of the strife between our kingdoms.

 If there is a meeting, there will always be a parting.

 Now that I think of it, if the real memorial ceremony had gone smoothly and occurred as planned, then Efa would already be returning to her kingdom.
 
 But because things had gone amiss, I was able to spend more time with Efa.
 I need not regret―

 クリス「(―But she was able to stay with me because she got hurt and lost her wing...)」

 クリス「(―I'm not alone.)」
 Dua will always be by my side as my bodyguard.

 Not just them... many others as well, all for the sake of I and this kingdom―

 The gravity of our words departed us in a simultaneous sigh, prompting a small laugh from both of us.

 My previously heavy footsteps had now lightened, and I was able to walk normally.
 I decided to take this chance to tell Dua straight what had been bothering me.
 Her standing was different from mine, yet she was always by my side.
 That's why she might be able to advise me well.

 Only after seeing the surprise on Dua's face did I realize I'd been a bit too honest.
 v21cr0748
 クリス「―Please forget what I just said.」
 v25du0500

 dua_b01
 v25du0501

 I felt relieved that she had no issue with what I had said.

 クリス「What is it?」
 v25du0503

 That was all I was able to say.
 I had no idea how to express myself.
 v21cr0753

 How frustrating it is being unable to say my heartfelt thoughts, even though they strove to emerge from my throat.

 クリス「But, why ask me something like that?」
 dua_b05
 v25du0504

 After answering the same way I did, Dua shook her head.
 For a moment I thought she was trying to imitate me, but the only one who would do that is Coco.

 Just as we arrived at my chamber, the answer to the question came to mind.
 
 Efa and Coco.
 I wanted to have them both by my side.

 That's why, this is the ideal location―

 val_b01
 v26va0340
 ヴァレ「That depends on the time and place, don't you think?」
 I would never had imagined that this man would want to meet me.
 Normally, I would have immediately showed his letter of invitation to Lord Ein, but I was unable to do so.

 v25du0512
 デュア「I came alone, just as you wanted me to.」
 I hadn't told any of my subordinates that Valery came to the castle.
 The one who had escorted him from the back gate to this place was me, after all.
 If it were yesterday or any day before that, I would have reached my hand for my sword the moment I saw him.

 I can't bring myself to converse seriously with this man anymore.
 black450
 Still, Valery was spot on.
 One of the people in the group of representatives was a relative on my mother's side of the family.
 To put it another way, that person was from a distant branch family of the Carlstedt family, and she was involved in the politics of Cardinal.
 However, during my communication with her up until now. I have never once divulged information about Weiss to that person.
 If we were to speak of lineage, almost every person from Weiss has their family roots in the Red or Blue Kingdom.

 The meaning of his words rested on a dagger that was hidden in his right sleeve. Its tip was now pointing straight at the left side of my torso.
 
 v25du0543
 デュア「(―Kuh!)」
 Even though I could strike more quickly than he, in this situation, we would end up both injured. 
 Though my blade is deadly, if my target is not at a distance at which I'm able to use it to protect myself... it is but a useless stick.

 Though I don't think I would lose such a fight, nor would he come out of it unscathed...
 If I killed him and won, the death of the Blue Ambassador would not be of benefit to Weiss.
 In the worst-case scenario, it might even lead to war.
 bg52b03
 val_b02
 v26va0383
 ヴァレ「I deeply appreciate your wise judgment.」
 With that, Valery placed his hand back into his pocket, while my sword slid back into its sheath.

 エファ「(―Though I have all the time in the world...)」
 To a human like Her Highness, her life is short and precious.
 Being able to speak to her right now like this made me truly happy, but when night comes, naturally I must rest.
 
 I wished to tell her that it is possible for Dolls to continue acting through the night without rest, but by doing that I would be using more energy than necessary, and must replenish it later by sleeping.

 That emotion of mine is real, and it has been growing stronger day by day ever since I came to Weiss.

 But still, the day of our separation is inevitable. 
 I will return to the Red Kingdom; that is something that was already decided even before I arrived here.

 I closed my eyes and tried to summon my memories.
 I remembered the time where I had performed in a play out in the open streets, and the times I had traveled for performances. 
 However, I wasn't able to form a clear picture of those scenes within my memory, so I was lost about how to express them.
 
 v22ef0448
 エファ「(―Why? Even though I'm a doll that can never forget anything I've seen or heard... why can't I remember the past clearly...)」
 
 
 For some reason, all the memories that I can remember clearly were the memories I shared with Her Highness.

 At the moment, I felt nothing but disgust when I imagined that someone else other than Her Highness were to touch me.

 エファ「(―I'm sorry.)」
 I didn't want Her Highness to scold me, so I apologized to her inside my heart.
 Still, in truth... I don't think being scolded by Her Highness is at all unpleasant.

 This feeling of insecurity was definitely not something that could be cured by tuning.

 At Efa's farewell party last night, the Princess dismissed all of her servants... and silently had dinner alone with Efa in the dining hall.
 
 Since it was the Princess's wish, naturally we did as she asked.

 Upon that night, as I stood in the hallway before the door of the dining hall... the invitation from Lord Ein to have dinner with him rose to my mind- he said that Coco would be there as well.
 
 
 However, if I were to eat together along with Coco― always so innocent― the atmosphere would surely become more depressing.
 
 Coco's cheerfulness would have the opposite effect and increase the somber atmosphere... thus I declined his invitation.

 Unable to banish that concern, I began wondering what I could do for the Princess's sake.

 As I accompanied the Princess to her chamber, she had not said even a single word.

 クリス「―Take care, Efa. May we meet again some day.」
 In the hallway in front of the courtyard, after the Princess bid farewell to Efa with a smile, she immediately turned around and went back to her chamber. 
 
 I had thought the Princess would keep her composure and see her off at the front gate, so I was surprised by her sudden action, however―

 I don't think I can understand what the Princess thinks. We are different people.

 As long as she is the ruler of Weiss, she is obliged to live like this and never forget her position for even a moment, until her successor sits upon the throne.

 According to the manager, the location where the group that had brought Efa from the castle were meeting the others was not in the city, but on a road near the border of the Red Kingdom.
 
 
 So they didn't want to waste any time so that they can return back to the kingdom quicker, eh? What a bad timing for them to make that decision.
 
 I got back on my horse and headed for the border of the Red Kingdom.

 If they had by any chance crossed the border, then it will be difficult for me to catch up due to the formalities I'd be subject to crossing the border after them.

 Their weapons were mismatched, their archers were uncoordinated and attacking indiscriminately- it was a group nothing like a proper army.

 It seems these greedy bandits had found their target before I had.

 Suddenly, from behind my back, I heard a sharp sound slicing through the air!
 v25du0617

 I saw one... no, two arrows plunge into the woods nearby. I lowered my body just enough that Efa wasn't hit, and spurred the horse to go faster.

 デュア「That's why, I'll surely bring you back to the Princess's side!」
 v22ef0478

 I felt Efa's arms tighten around me, as if she were transmitting her feelings to me.

 v25du0629
 デュア「―Keep quiet! We're entering the woods now!」
 
 
 
 I endured the pain in my shoulder and took a right turn.
 As I glanced behind me, I spotted three or four horses in pursuit.
 v25du0630
 デュア「(―Can I shake them off?)」
 Even though Efa is light, we're two people riding a single horse.
 In addition, since I need to handle the reins too, it's safe to say that those pursuing us are closing the distance.
 
 v25du0631
 デュア「(―How far are they going to chase us?)」
 I can't go into the main road, it might affect other passersby.
 Furthermore, if I don't increase my distance from them, I'll be at risk from their arrows.

 I had saved Efa from the bandits that attacked the group of Red representatives, and―

 Still, the pain of the blow to my back I received in that final moment gradually began to surface.

 rmsg_a03
 v29da0072
 団長「No, you have mine as well. I could not decide whether I should request an audience with you.」
 As I looked at the woman before me, who had just arrived in this audience hall, I recalled our meeting a few days ago in my office.
 
 
 
 v24ei0522
 アイン「(―The meeting we had before the three kingdoms' conference, that is.)」
 It was quite an unpleasant memory. How fine it would be if I could turn the clock back and return to that moment. 
 
 v24ei0523
 アイン「How are your injuries?」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0073
 団長「Fortunately, I was injured only lightly, so do not worry about me.」
 Though the head representative's voice was firm, in contrast to her words, I could feel the pain within them. 
 Originally, she would have been freed of the burden of ‘head representative’ when she got back to her kingdom, but instead, here she is in Dornstein Castle once more. 
 Well, it could have been much worse.
 
 After all, she was among the group of representatives that was attacked near the Red Kingdom's border.
 In the chaos, she lost her senses, fainted, and was later saved by the border guards from the White Kingdom when they arrived.
 
 As the sole survivor, she had come to hate the outdoors- thus why our meeting right now was being held in the audience hall, whose only windows look on the courtyard.
 
 v24ei0524
 アイン「I'll prepare a seat for you right this moment, so please wait a...」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0074
 団長「Lord Ein. Your kindness is appreciated, but I do not intend to stay here for long.」
 Her manner of speaking, curt and swift, certainly hasn't changed.
 v24ei0525
 アイン「But even if it's just for a moment, your health―」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0075
 団長「Enough about me, I'm worried about Efa... is our national treasure safe?」
 
 The impatient tuner brushed aside my concern for her and, as was her duty, inquired about Efa instead.
 
 v24ei0526
 アイン「―Yes, she is fine.」
 Since Efa wasn't human, I hadn't counted her as a survivor when I had noted that the head representative was the sole survivor.
 Excluding her, there had been a total of twenty-one deaths among the representatives and the bodyguards that were to escort them back to their kingdom.
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0076
 団長「I am relieved to hear that. Now I can―」
 v24ei0527

 v29da0077
 団長「Yes.」
 Though she gave me a pointed look as she replied that, 
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0077-2
 団長「...However, before that there are matters we must resolve, I believe.」
  she sighed and dropped her head immediately after.
 As expected of the head of the representatives, she understood that she couldn't just return home and leave the matter of our foreign affairs unsolved.
 v24ei0528
 アイン「Then, please come over here.」
 rmsg_a01
 This time, she did not decline my proposal that she take a seat, and did so silently. I brought out the documents I had at hand, and began asking questions.
 
 v24ei0529
 アイン「First of all, regarding the attack on the group of representatives...」
 The location of the incident was an unstable locale near the kingdoms' border. Nominally, it was under Weiss's jurisdiction.
 
 
 Thus, naturally, we will be unable to avoid blame for the incident.
 However, the group of representatives had officially declared that they needed no guards from Weiss to escort them. 
 
 
 I regretted not insisting that we should detail soldiers to escort them, regardless of their wishes.
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0078
 団長「The one who rejected Weiss's proposal to provide additional protection was I.」
 
 
 v24ei0530
 アイン「......」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0079
 団長「―I was overconfident that we would safely meet with our border guards on our trip back.」
 Though the security near the borders had been maintained until now, due to the tension between our two kingdoms, the cooperation between our garrisons was hindered and we had been late in responding to the attack.
 
 
 v24ei0531
 アイン「Did you use a horse messenger to inform your kingdom of your return?」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0080
 団長「Yes, I sent the messenger the very day we decided the date on which to return.」
 v24ei0532
 アイン「Did you write your route and time of departure there as well?」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0081
 団長「Yes... do you mean...」
 Judging from her shocked expression, it seemed that she had more or less realized the intent of my questions.
 v24ei0533
 アイン「Have you considered that that information was compromised?」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0082
 団長「......」
 v24ei0534
 アイン「Comparing the possibilities, whether they received the intel of your route and time of departure in advance, then acted on that, or whether your group was merely unlucky, being mistaken for merchants―」
 If I were to choose one of those two possibilities...
 v24ei0535
 アイン「I believe that the former is definitely more likely.」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0083
 団長「...Lord Ein, please explain to me the reasons behind that claim.」
 v24ei0536
 アイン「Well, my conclusion is that their target was Efa.」
 
 
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0084
 団長「And what is your evidence?」
 v24ei0537
 アイン「The evidence is that according to Efa's testimony―」
 v24ei0538
 アイン「When Dua arrived on the scene, took Efa and tried to escape, the bandits still chased after them.」
 v24ei0539
 アイン「If they were but petty robbers, that they would have decided to pursue them after witnessing Dua's swordsmanship... I find that hard to believe.」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0085
 団長「―What if they believed Efa was of great value?」
 v24ei0540
 アイン「Yes, that is possible, since they would have recognized Efa as a doll from her wing.」
 
 v24ei0541
 アイン「...However, I do not believe that they would be so tenacious as to gamble their lives against a swordsman just for the sake of taking her.」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0086
 団長「So you're saying that judging from the risks those bandits were willing to take to get her, their target was Efa from the very beginning, yes?」
 
 v24ei0542
 アイン「Yes. Of course, there is the possibility that that might not be the reason and they pursued her merely as a target of opportunity.」
 v24ei0543
 アイン「However, though Efa's unparalleled design is apparent even to the eyes of amateurs, if there were no one to fence her to... then she is naught but a piece of wood.」
 
 
 
 rmsg_a03
 Was she displeased by what I had said? Her expression had soured slightly...
 But even so, she did not deny my judgment. Apparently she was able to see my point.
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0087
 団長「Then, is it possible someone amongst the bandits recognized Efa as the national treasure of Cardinal?」
 
 v24ei0544
 アイン「I can't deny that possibility, but were there really someone as knowledgeable as that among those bandits, then they wouldn't have wanted to take Efa.」
 
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0088
 団長「...Why do you say so?」
 v24ei0545
 アイン「I doubt any would expect to find a buyer for the Red Kingdom's treasure. Withal, if they escaped with a doll of such value, the kingdoms would surely wager their dignity upon an all-out manhunt.」
 
 
 v24ei0546
 アイン「Furthermore, I don't think they would dare to demand a ransom from a great kingdom.」
 
 
 v24ei0547
 アイン「―If worst came to worst for them, they might even be hunted down by other bandits and turned in to Cardinal for the bounty.」
 It would not be an exchange of a doll for gold, but an exchange of their own lives for gold... nobody in their right mind would choose a fate like that.
 v24ei0548
 アイン「...What do you think?」
 rmsg_a03
 v29da0089
 団長「Your claim does seem logical and in line with the evidence... do you know anything more?」
 v24ei0549
 アイン「The guards from Weiss that rescued you investigated the surrounding areas, and as a result, they discovered the bandits' camp.」
 rmsg_a01
 v29da0090
 団長「...Eh?」
 v24ei0550
 アイン「Unfortunately there was not a living soul in the area, so we were unable to obtain any testimony from the raiders, however―」
 
 v24ei0551
 アイン「The dead bandits we found there were riddled with arrows. In their pockets, we found several items that belonged to the Red representatives.」
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0091
 団長「W-what does that mean?」
 v24ei0552
 アイン「The ones who attacked the group of representatives wished to seal their lips. So as not to be found out as the bandits at fault, they left their spoils on their dead comrades for us to retrieve...」
 
 v24ei0553
 アイン「―Which means, we have yet to discover the bandits' final secret.」
 
 rmsg_a03

 The head representative bit her lip, pressed her hands together in front of her chest, and recited a brief prayer with her eyes closed.

 After finishing her ritual, she slowly raised her head and gazed towards me.
 
 rmsg_a02

 But, if I speak that man's name in front of the representative of the Red―
 rmsg_a02
 v29da0098
 団長「...Could it be that you suspect me, Lord Ein?」
 black450
 A few days ago, I would have considered that as a possibility. However, at the moment, I could suspect only the Blue Ambassador- Valery.
 
 Of course, it was not impossible that she was secretly collaborating with Valery.
 However, I have no extra brainpower to consider such an unlikely situation.
 Valery always takes care that his plots can never be traced back to him, and when it is most opportune, he uses others to shield himself.

 ワカバ「I'll get taller too! Starting now!」
 
 Though I knew that I would be lying if I had said that I had no suspicion of her, I must shake my head in denial.

 ヴァレ「―Seems like my plan isn't going too well.」
 Before today, there have been countless times my plans have gone off course, but in the end my final backup plans- serving as insurance if anything occurs- always do the job.
 At the three kingdoms' conference, Ein had set me up fairly well, and I was on edge.
 
 
 Not only had he managed to avert the declaration of war, my plan had been in danger of being completely exposed by Hans.
 ...However, I was still residing in this castle in the role of an ambassador, so dealing with that situation was within my means.
 
 
 But this time―
 val_d01
 v26va0387
 ヴァレ「...Am I out of ideas?」
  I couldn't find a suitable strategy to overcome this.
 val_d03
 v26va0388
 ヴァレ「Staying so long in this countryside place has done a number on my mental acuity.」
 I can barely recall anything pleasant happening since the day I came to this kingdom.
 The only pleasant thing might be that I can drink immature wine all I please; it's rather difficult to obtain in Blew.
 val_d01
 v26va0389
 ヴァレ「―Wine, eh?」
  I recalled a nostalgic memory.
 Tilting the wine glass in my hand, I remembered the time of my first secret meeting in the guest room with those two.
 
 val_d02
 v26va0390
 ヴァレ「...Fufufu, what a fun man to tease you were, Lord Jussi.」
 When we first met, he quarreled with me from the start. But seeing in him a kindred soul, I dealt with him courteously.
 
 black450
 However, that man―
 jus_d01
 v26va0391
 ヴァレ「―Died from falling down a staircase.」
 black450
 His unexpected death alarmed me, making me worry for a moment that Ein knew about my plan.
 
 But the truth was soon revealed that he had died in a manner so foolish one could not even laugh at it, without contributing anything at all to the plan.
 
 v26va0392
 ヴァレ「...No, no. He did prepare the dagger used on stage, after all.」
 bg57a01
 It would be kind to at least credit him with that.
 val_d02
 v26va0393
 ヴァレ「A toast to your efforts, Lord Jussi. Also―」
 I should follow the advice God gave me then... and take care not to drink too much wine.
 
 
 black450
 v26va0394
 ヴァレ「And then there was Hans...」
 han_d01
 Unlike Jussi, I had met him in the Blue Kingdom, and he made a much more suitable subordinate than had Jussi.
 But he had one weak point - his emotional fragility.
 black450
 v26va0395
 ヴァレ「...I should have trained him a little more in the Blue Kingdom.」
 Perhaps his failure had been focusing too much on the study of Doll Arts instead of weathering the battlefield of politics?
 
 v26va0396
 ヴァレ「(―No.)」
 bg57a01
 People cannot be guided down paths unfit for them. Hans had been a scholar at heart, and he could have been nothing other than that.
 
 
 
 val_d02
 v26va0397
 ヴァレ「Even so, he did his part well enough.」
 I had believed that he was a man that I could not expect much from, and gave him tasks within his means.
 Because of him, I was able to manipulate Efa through Coco.
 v26va0398
 ヴァレ「A toast to Lord Hans as well is only proper.」
 Regrettably, the pair of plans that I had prepared for the rehearsal and kept a secret from my comrades had both failed.
 
 val_d01
 v26va0399
 ヴァレ「Oh well, Lord Hans isn't to blame for that.」
 
 
 The fault rests upon that malfunction of that old doll of the Red's, rusty from her long slumber within the showcase.
 
 black450
 v26va0400
 ヴァレ「...Well, what's done is done. I should think no more of it.」
 But before toasting Hans, I must also consider that nameless assassin, musn't I?
 
 bg57a01
 v26va0401
 ヴァレ「...Though it is rather late, a toast to you, nameless man who desired a little money and his family's safety.」
 
 Though the brand of the wine had been different from what I had given Hans, the scentless poison that let them both embark on their journey to the afterworld had been the same.
 
 
 
 A dose of that poison costs quite a pretty penny in the Blue Kingdom.
 val_d02
 v26va0402
 ヴァレ「Fufufu, well, I owe him an apology that the wine didn't suit his taste.」
 black450

 As I closed my eyes, the knight that I had met in the courtyard upon that night surfaced in my mind.
 v26va0404
 ヴァレ「...Hmph, her sword skills were even with mine, eh?」
 
 
 Her swordsmanship had revived my lost touch, forgotten for several years while I resided in Blew. 
 v26va0405
 ヴァレ「(―How nice it would be if I could speak to her a little more.)」
 black450
 A loyal retainer who never stopped chanting the name of her Princess in one way or another.
 She was always focused on her duties, but had occasionally demonstrated that she was in fact a woman- while Ein was watching.
 
 v26va0406
 ヴァレ「Though she was extremely capable... she met her end anyway.」
 bg57a01
 If Ein had at least put some effort into catching her, there might be another thing worth remembering about my visit to this kingdom.
 
 val_d03
 v26va0407
 ヴァレ「―Well, that has nothing to do with me, does it.」
 I lightly raised the glass that I had used to give several toasts earlier, intending to give her one as well, but then noticed I had drained it dry.
 
 val_d02
 v26va0408
 ヴァレ「...Hah, the lady swordsman doesn't like wine, eh?」
 Well, actually, I'm the one that didn't like her.
 
 
 Thanks to her, my entertainment had been spoiled, after all.
 val_d04
 v26va0409
 ヴァレ「...That bitch.」
 I had gone out of my way to contact the Blue Kingdom and gather capable soldiers to my side.
 After that, I had them hire a group of bandits and attack those mongrels of the Red as they headed back to their wretched kingdom, their target Princess Christina's beloved doll. 
 
 
 But for some reason, Dua appeared out of nowhere and interfered. If I had expected that―
 
 val_d05
 v26va0410
 ヴァレ「Dua stealing Efa from the group of representatives, that would have been the perfect scenario.」
 The loyal knight bringing back the doll for her beloved Princess... if that had happened, it would add quite a spice to the conspiracy I've been building.
 
 
 
 To create a disturbance on the border of the two kingdoms, a bone of contention upon which the military preparations beneath the calm can transform into limitless expansion.
 
 That is what I had planned, what I was anticipating, what was supposed to happen! But now, everything has gone wrong.
 
 val_d01
 v26va0411
 ヴァレ「―Hmph, enough of this foolish grumbling.」
 Nothing will change if I continue to pity myself, and furthermore―
 val_d02
 v26va0412
 ヴァレ「It's about time the last of the Red representatives finished her meeting.」
 
 
 ...Which means, the next to seek an audience with Ein shall be me.
 val_d03
 v26va0413
 ヴァレ「Farewell, my deceased fellows.」
 Do get along with each other. You're all comrades in death now, are you not?
 On the other hand, for I, who still lives, some unfinished business remains.
 val_d01
 v26va0414
 ヴァレ「...This is just the beginning...」
 I anticipate with baited breath what Ein shall say in our meeting today.
 If he is not only wise but cunning as well, and begs me to spare his life at the end of our conversation―
 
 
 
 val_d02
 v26va0415
 ヴァレ「It would not be a bad idea to enlist another subject for the Blue Kingdom.」
 But if that doesn't happen... well, I guess what remains for me is to propose that I join his side.

 v26va0416

 Those words which I had recited upon a small hill during her funeral earlier still rang within my ear.

 Dua, the sole child of her heirless family, had brought pride to the Carlstedt family name that had been tarnished with scandal over the years.

 Now that I look back, I realized how important she had been.

 bg52b02
 v24ei0586
 アイン「So I should have listened to the expert's advice after all, eh?」
 Our kingdom had never waged war since the day of creation, and most of the soldiers we had were inexperienced greenhorns employed for the purpose of self-defense.
 
 Among them, Dua had a natural gift and exceptional skill, and possessed an excellent record from not only Weiss's tournaments, but those of other kingdoms as well.

 At first I thought that she didn't mean it, but at that time,
 dua_e04
 v25du0695
 デュア「I'm going to prove to you that I'm not as strong as people claim.」

 dua_e02

 Act upon the principle that Princess is even more important?
 ein_d06

 アイン「...If it were Dua, she would surely choose the latter...」
 In the end, I needed not ask her to know the answer.
 bg52b02
 I am confident that I had understood Dua far better than anyone else.
 Though she'd been soldier, she had not been just your typical brawn-over-brains type.
 Furthermore, she had always made the Princess her highest priority.
 That was why I was able to entrust to her duty of guard captain under the direct command of the Princess without worry, while I concentrated on the affairs of state.
 Dua, who always argued over every little detail with me... and I, who was always composed and deep in thought.
 
 
 
 From the perspective of the people around us, it must have seemed to them that we were a pair who didn't get along with each other. 
 But even so, we both―

 アイン「...Sorry for making you wait.」
  and the person I had been waiting for entered the audience hall.
 v26va0422
 ヴァレ「My my, Lord Ein, what a long time it has been.」
 v24ei0602
 アイン「Yes, I am deeply sorry for repeatedly declining your request for an audience, Lord Valery.」

 ein_b06
 v24ei0603
 アイン「...You have my gratitude.」
 Ein nodded slightly, and passed behind me.
 bg53a03
 As he reached the table that had likely been brought especially for our meeting, he placed the various documents and such he had at hand on it...
 
 v26va0424
 ヴァレ「...Oh, Lord Ein. I arrived early, so I borrowed the chair beforehand, hope you don't mind.」
 I grinned as I indicated my justaucorps that hung on the back of the chair.

 v26va0426

 I was thrown off guard that he hadn't even offered a single word of apology for his tardiness, and instead was in a hurry to start.
 
 ...Well, I don't think common courtesy would be of any use in this conversation anyway.
 
 If he has no interest in making small talk, I can bring up the topic at hand straight away.

 v26va0429

 ein_b05
 v24ei0617
 アイン「...Since you're the one who requested this audience, shouldn't you be the one to bring up our main topic? But instead you question me, and await my response. Aren't you the one being circumspect here?」
 
 
 v26va0441
 ヴァレ「...Fu, fufufufu... fuhahahaha!」
 The manner in which he had masterfully reflected my sarcasm back at me compelled me to laugh quite spontaneously.
 
 ein_b01

 v26va0442
 ヴァレ「Oh, no, my apologies. It's just, it's just that...」
 bg53a03
 v26va0443
 ヴァレ「(―Not bad, not bad at all, Ein!)」
 Just when I thought that this steward had lost his touch, he was actually waiting for the chance to strike back at me!
 v26va0444
 ヴァレ「―Very well, I have decided! I shall go straight to the point. Lord Ein, does Weiss wish to form an alliance with Blew?」
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ein_b04
 v24ei0619
 アイン「An alliance?」
 v26va0445
 ヴァレ「That's right! Of course, I don't mean an alliance like that you have been in until now, smothered between the Red and the Blue.」
 
 ein_b05
 v24ei0620
 アイン「So, cut ties with Cardinal, and join Blew?」
 
 
 
 
  As I said that, Ein smiled.
 He had definitely... smiled.
 black450
 v26va0446
 ヴァレ「(―A fine fellow!)」
 I can use this man. He will be far more useful than any other man I have ever met!
 He has excellent control of his visage, well separated from his inner thoughts, with equally exceptional talent and status.
 And most importantly... the record of his achievements throughout his time managing this kingdom! 
 bg53a03
 v26va0447
 ヴァレ「Exactly as you say! I want you to cut ties with Cardinal, and join us, Blew!」
 
 
 
 
 v26va0448
 ヴァレ「Of course, we will not treat you badly.」
 v26va0449
 ヴァレ「The reception we shall give you is equivalent to that if you remain in Weiss... no, I promise that your life shall be more luxurious than that.」
 
 
 
 ―Oh, how I love men who are sensible.
 If I had known about him sooner, I would have ignored Jussi and Hans, and straight away―
 ein_b06
 v24ei0621
 アイン「Lord Valery.」
 v26va0450
 ヴァレ「What is it, Lord Ein?」
 ein_b05

 Had I misheard him?
 ein_b07

 Upon noticing that he no longer deigned even to address me as ‘Lord’, my excitement plummeted instantly.

 black450
 v26va0458
 ヴァレ「A fine observation, Ein. It is as you say, therefore...」
 I snapped my finger, which was the signal to my people waiting in a dark corner of the hallway.
 ...However, it doesn't seem they are there to respond to it.
 v24ei0629

 ...Still, had he been expecting that? He avoided it by a distance of a hair's breadth.

 As he said that, Ein seized a dagger hidden among the documents on the table.
 v26va0462

 v24ei0632
 アイン「Take a close look, Valery. I'm sure you remember what this is!」
 v26va0463
 ヴァレ「(―Hoh!)」
 The dagger that Ein was wielding in his right hand... was the ‘genuine dagger’ I had Jussi make for the purpose of killing Christina. 
 
 v24ei0633
 アイン「You told Jussi to make this, and had Hans switch it with the prop, right?」
 v26va0464
 ヴァレ「...Correct. Though it's unsuitable to be used on stage, it's a rather fine dagger, is it not?」
 With the table between us, we faced off against each other.
 v24ei0634
 アイン「You modified the play's script, and intended to let Efa take the life of the Lady.」
 Slowly, we both started moving sideways towards an arena with more freedom.
 v24ei0635

 And then, at the very moment when the space between us was open.

 It is exactly as he said.

 Previously during our fight, the dagger I had used had fallen to the floor.
 While conversely, my opponent had in hand right now―

 ―a long saber.
 
 
 Empty-handed versus a saber, I have no chance of winning.
 v24ei0651
 アイン「(―He's more skilled than I am, too.)」
 If I managed to snatch his saber, then I would have a chance of winning.
 ...However, I understood that I do not possess the skills to perform such an act, thus eliminating it from my available choices. 
 v24ei0652
 アイン「(―Then what should I do?)」
 There are two daggers on the floor, and the one closest to me was... the one I had dropped.
 
 But if I tried to pick it up, without a doubt―

 A kind and gentle voice came to my ears. For a moment, I thought that I was dreaming
 
 But, this time, I was certain that I wasn't―

 Upon realizing that it could be no one other than Her Highness, my heart calmed down greatly.

 The worry that ‘what if Her Highness never comes back to this room?’ had been in my mind for the past couple of days,

 I had been like that ever since I came back to the Dornstein Castle.

  What was hurting me now was―

 v22ef0539

 I did not understood why Her Highness's words had come to a halt.
  It was just as she said... I had been waiting inside the room, not taking a single step out all this while.
 Of course, even though I knew not when, Her Highness would still come back.
  In addition, when she was within her chamber, she spent her time with me.
 That's why, I don't think Her Highness had anything to be worrying about... why does she look so sad.

  She interrupted me.
 v21cr0843
 クリス「I would never desire that I ‘order’ you. Act for your own sake and no one else's.」
 
 
 She spoke those words in a firm voice―

  and eyes full of resolve.

 ...All of my energy departed my body in an instant.
 v22ef0543
 エファ「...Yes.」
 ―I've only been seeking her attention, in whichever form it may come.
 Upon realizing that my own naivete was the reason Her Highness was scolding me, I lowered my head, feeling deeply ashamed.
 
 Still, I must answer her question... I tried to do that, but my lips wouldn't even move- as if there were someone's finger placed before them, sealing my speech.
 
 I hated this part of me, the aspect that always wants to just close my eyes and escape from reality―
 chr_a01
 v21cr0846

 Concerned by what she had said, I raised my head and looked at her face.

 Just as I was about to say ‘no’, Her Highness quietly closed her eyes.

  she murmured with her head slightly lowered.

 Until now, I had signed countless permits for executions, and even witnessed them, but none of those experiences were at the same level as taking a human life myself.

 v24ei0679
 アイン「...Valery.」
 Among all of the people I have met, he was the one who was the most difficult for me to understand.
 Choosing the wrong path even though he has such talents, toying with other humans' lives as if it were a game, embracing the sin within himself, and leaving a trail of corpses wherever he went.
 
 What did he truly desire?
 ein_d06

 In his wish to initiate such an immense amount of bloodshed, had he not considered the possibility that the people he held dear would be affected?

 v24ei0683
 アイン「...I should clean up things that are right in front of my eyes first, I guess.」
 Last night, the people who came with Valery when he entered the audience hall, had been all thrown into the dungeon for ‘trespassing’ when they neared the audience hall.
 
 As expected of Valery's subordinates, they all said that ‘this was an order’, refused to say anything that could be used as evidence against their master, and waited quietly for their detainment to end.

 I have a close friend in the Blue Kingdom. I'll try to contact him, then ask him to find a way to solve this problem from within their country.
 
 Still, honestly, saying that Valery was plotting against the White Kingdom will inevitably draw protest from them, and the nobles from the Blue Kingdom will likely never admit to it.
 
 v24ei0686
 アイン「...Still, the problem lies not only with the Blue...」
 The Red Kingdom, who seemed more amiable to us, were also dangerous.
 In the worst-case scenario, they could be watching our kingdom and the Blue like a hawk, eyeing our weak spots, waiting for their chance.

 I've always thought only for myself, without regards to others.
 Whenever I wanted her to be with me, I would call her to my side, and whenever I wanted to be alone, I would leave her to wait inside the room and go out by myself.
 
 And what I was doing was―

 I went into the hall, barred anyone else from entering, and wept like a child, longing for the knight that had granted my foolish wish.

 That's right, I mustn't keep on grieving.
 In a few days, the Red Kingdom shall send a wing for Efa, which will replace the wing that was injured at the rehearsal.
 
 After the top engineers of my country finish reattaching the wing, I shall tune her myself to help her regain sensation in it.
 
 And once that is complete, Efa will have to return to her homeland, the Red Kingdom.

 Without a doubt... I love her.
 As I was born fated to be a tuner, I was blessed with the chance to understand dolls much more deeply than do other people. 
 
 
 Because of that, I am considerate of dolls... far more so than anyone else is.

 If the feeling of love I have for dolls were that of love for one's family, then the feelings I have for Coco and Efa should be the same.

 エファ「Is there something on my face?」
 v21cr0876
 クリス「Well, what do you think?」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0561
 エファ「Eh?!」
 Efa's reaction was one of panic.
 After searching her face with her hands and finding nothing amiss, she glared at me.
 
 v21cr0877
 クリス「Perhaps I went too far. Please forgive me.」
 efa_e06
 v22ef0562
 エファ「...Y-you're so mean, Your Highness...」
 v21cr0878
 クリス「Eh?」
 v22ef0563
 エファ「If you apologize to me like that, then how can I say anything back to you?」
 v21cr0879
 クリス「(―Oh, my.)」
 Efa seemed unhappy that I had made it impossible for her to blame me.
 
 v21cr0880
 クリス「Then... what would you prefer that I do?」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0564
 エファ「―I... don't know. I believe that you should be able to decide for yourself, Your Highness.」
 
 v21cr0881
 クリス「And what if I do not know what I should do, either?」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0565
 エファ「...?」
 v21cr0882
 クリス「Specifically, I ask you, ‘what would you have me do?’」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0566
 エファ「......W-well, that's...」
 Did she have something in mind, but was hesitant to say it?
 It seemed so, as she was desperately trying to avoid my eyes, glancing at the walls and the windows.
 
 v21cr0883
 クリス「Now, now. if you have something to say, then do so.」
 efa_e06
 v22ef0567
 エファ「...You bully...」
 v21cr0884
 クリス「Eh?」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0568
 エファ「I said you're a bully, Your Highness! Even if you knew how I feel, you purposely tease me...」
 
 
 efa_e07
 As I saw her shoulders drop and she covered her face with both of her hands, I realized that I really had gone too far.
 
 v21cr0885
 クリス「Aah, Efa, I'm so sorry!
 I didn't mean to do more than play with you a little...」
 I quickly hurried to where she was and took her into my arms, sincerely regretting my actions―
 efa_e07
 v22ef0569
 エファ「...Uuu...」
 v21cr0886
 クリス「...Aah, don't cry, Efa.」
 v22ef0570
 エファ「Please... just forget everything about me.」
 
 v21cr0887
 クリス「Don't say something so foolish.」
 v22ef0571
 エファ「I can't be of any use to you, Your Highness, I am but a doll.」
 
 v21cr0888
 クリス「...Efa...」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0572
 エファ「―I can't protect you like Dua either, Your Highness...」
 Upon hearing that, my body grew tense.
 v21cr0889
 クリス「......」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0573
 エファ「...Your, Highness?
 Um, Your Highness...」
 v21cr0890
 クリス「―Dua...」
 Efa was here, and Dua was not.
  Dua had left me what I had wished for... and that was Efa.
 efa_e04
 v22ef0574
 エファ「―Aaah!
 Please pardon me, Your Highness, I didn't think of your feelings...」
 v21cr0891
 クリス「...Do not worry, Efa.」
 She recognized that she had said too much, so there was no need to scold her. Though I was shaken by her words, I shall forgive her.
 
 v21cr0892
 クリス「All humans eventually perish. ...Rather than mourning or not mourning her death, if only I could have―」
 
 efa_e06
 v22ef0575
 エファ「...It's my fault!」
 As I was confessing, Efa shouted in a voice that filled the whole room.
 v21cr0893
 クリス「...What are you saying? It is in no way...」
 v22ef0576
 エファ「No, it's my fault. If I, if I had been stronger...」
 v21cr0894
 クリス「―If you had been stronger, what would you have done?」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0577
 エファ「......」
  Efa grew still as death as I asked her that.
 v21cr0895
 クリス「No matter what you had done, I do not believe Dua's fate would have changed.」
 Those were not words to hurt Efa.
 The seed of Dua's death was sowed by I alone. Efa bears no responsibility for it whatsoever.
 No matter how strongly she denies that, I must correct her misconception and convince her she is wrong.
 efa_e06
 v22ef0578
 エファ「Is that because... I'm a doll that can't do anything?」
 v21cr0896
 クリス「...」
 v22ef0579
 エファ「...Since I'm such a helpless doll, not only could I not assist Dua, I was even a burden to her...」
 
 v21cr0897
 クリス「I do not mind, even if you want to think it that way... however!」
 v21cr0898
 クリス「―Please realize that your sins bear no comparison to those of the other whom stands here.」
 
 efa_e04
 v22ef0580
 エファ「...?」
 v21cr0899
 クリス「―On that day, the person who sent Dua to bring you back, was...... was I.」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0581
 エファ「...Eh!?」
 v21cr0900
 クリス「I, I... I wished for a future where I was able to live with you. That's why I requested that of Dua.」
 v22ef0582
 エファ「...Your, Highness...?」
 v21cr0901
 クリス「I want to abandon this White Kingdom, and live alongside with...」
 
 
 efa_e04
 v22ef0583
 エファ「Don't say anything more than that!」
 Efa's shockingly loud voice stopped my confession short.
 
 
 
 efa_e07
 v22ef0584
 エファ「―You've already said enough...」
 I gazed into her tear-filled eyes as she looked up me, searching for the words to explain herself―
 v21cr0902
 クリス「...Yes, you're right.」
 Though it might be different from what she meant to say, I had my own interpretation of what she meant.
 The thought of abandoning the kingdom had gone through my mind, but as long as I am still the symbolic ruler of this kingdom, I mustn't speak such disquieting words.
 My confession should be heard by God alone.
 v21cr0903
 クリス「(―Aah, and Efa... she's...)」
 She's like a messenger from God who came to answer my prayers... just by imagining that I felt that I had found salvation.
 v21cr0904
 クリス「...Then, please keep that confession I intended to make inside your heart.」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0585
 エファ「Okay.」
 v21cr0905
 クリス「Also... I shall not allow you to speak of yourself in such degrading terms as you did earlier...」
 
 v22ef0586
 エファ「What do you mean?」
 v21cr0906
 クリス「Those words about you being helpless, and just a burden.」
 efa_e06
 v22ef0587
 エファ「Please do not be upset. Those words are true, I am just―」
 v21cr0907
 クリス「―You are mistaken!」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0588
 エファ「Eh?」
 v21cr0908
 クリス「You had no way to prevent Dua's death... so please, do not speak such...」
 
 efa_e02
 v22ef0589
 エファ「Thank you.」
 That was the smile of an angel... enough to purify all my sins and ignite new courage from within me.
 
 This might be the chance... I might be able to say my true feelings at this very moment.
 
 v21cr0909
 クリス「...E-Efa.」
 efa_e01
 v22ef0590
 エファ「Yes.」
 v21cr0910
 クリス「About what I said earlier...」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0591
 エファ「??」
 v21cr0911
 クリス「To me, you are... someone... very precious.」
 Even though I couldn't say it properly, even though I should have made my words clearer... despite that, I still wanted to reveal my heart to Efa.
 
 efa_e04
 v22ef0592
 エファ「U, um... I... feel the... same way. But, I...」
 v21cr0912
 クリス「W-what is it?」
 v22ef0593
 エファ「N-no, if I say something like that...」
 v21cr0913
 クリス「Please tell.」
 efa_e06
 v22ef0594
 エファ「...I can never protect you like Dua would have, Your Highness.」
 v21cr0914
 クリス「(―And I thought she was going to say...)」
 Dua was Dua. She had always been a precious person to me, and that fact will never change.
 
 v21cr0915
 クリス「(―But then, what about Efa?)」
 Saying it straight was too embarrassing... perhaps there's a metaphor I could use?
 v21cr0916
 クリス「(―Ah...)」
 An idea came to me.
 v21cr0917
 クリス「...You are like my precious sister.」
 
 
 efa_e05
 v22ef0595
 エファ「―Your sister?」
 v21cr0918
 クリス「...Yes. O-or would you prefer our relationship be described some other way...」
 A better way to put it might be―
 efa_e03
 v22ef0596
 エファ「I'm truly happy.」
 Efa said, joining her hands together before her chest.
 efa_e04
 v22ef0597
 エファ「But, Your Highness, a doll like me being sister to a human like you... don't you think that would lower your status in the eyes of others?」
 
 v21cr0919
 クリス「Is that what you are worried about?」
 v22ef0598
 エファ「Y-yes.」
 v21cr0920
 クリス「Then let us do this.」
 A splendid idea entered my mind.
 v21cr0921
 クリス「You dolls serve God, and are referred to as Angels of the Tenth Rank, is that not so?」
 
 
 efa_e01
 v22ef0599
 エファ「Yes, that is correct.」
 v21cr0922
 クリス「While nuns who serve God are referred to as Sisters.」
 
 v21cr0923
 クリス「In reference to that, from now on all of you dolls shall be called ‘Sisters.’」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0600
 エファ「...All of us... dolls?」
 v21cr0924
 クリス「That way, everyone shall be equal... what do you think?」
 efa_e01
 v22ef0601
 エファ「...That does seem more august.」
 v21cr0925
 クリス「Then it is decided. You are my Sister.」
 v22ef0602
 エファ「...Saying that I am ‘your nun’ is a little strange, though.」
 v21cr0926
 クリス「You are not a nun. You and I are sisters.」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0603
 エファ「Eh, b-but... that's...」
 v21cr0927
 クリス「You have already agreed to it, so cease your protests.」
 efa_e04
 v22ef0604
 エファ「B-but, Your Highness, that's...」
 v21cr0928
 クリス「Then how about ‘my one and only Sister?’」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0605
 エファ「...But... How, could I...」
 v21cr0929
 クリス「Are you not satisfied?」
 efa_e02
 v22ef0606
 エファ「...No. It is truly... an honor.」
 I was relieved as she finally accepted my proposal.
 ...After the tension gradually left her, as if exhausted, she fell towards me.
 
 v21cr0930
 クリス「...Efa, are you okay?」
 efa_e06
 v22ef0607
 エファ「Please forgive me, Your Highness. My body is a little...」
 v21cr0931
 クリス「―Let me give you a check-up right now.」
 Noticing that her cheeks were flushed red, I placed my hand on her forehead.
 
 v21cr0932
 クリス「―It seems that you have a fever. Before I tune you, it would be better if you...」
 Judging that it would be better for her to rest first, I tried to carry her to the bed, but it seemed her body was heavier than I had expected.

 After avoiding the pillar supporting the ceiling, as I tried to place Efa's body upon the bed―
 
 v21cr0933
 クリス「...It seems I have fallen down as well.」
 I fell down together with her, and when I recovered, I was lying down on the bed together with her, side by side.
 v22ef0608
 エファ「Are you okay, Your Highness?」
 v21cr0934
 クリス「Yes, I am. How about you?
 If your wing is uncomfortable...」
 v22ef0609
 エファ「I am fine. It's just that my clothes are a little...」

 The straps of her dress had slipped off her shoulders, and it made her look slovenly.
 v21cr0935
 クリス「...My, how unseemly.」
 I reached out to fix them, but before my fingers reached her shoulder...
 v22ef0610
 エファ「...Your, High... ness...」
 v21cr0936
 クリス「...E-fa...」
 sv912a
 sv912b
 As if guided by her subconscious, Efa's fingers wrapped around mine one by one, and did not let go.
 
 v21cr0937
 クリス「I'll fix the straps of your dress, so you should let go of my...」
 v22ef0611
 エファ「...Rather than that, please... tune me.」
 v21cr0938
 クリス「But you should rest, and wait until your fever has broken―」
 v22ef0612
 エファ「...No, Your Highness. Please, right now... tune me...」
 v21cr0939
 クリス「Could it be that you're overheating?」
 If Efa's fever was the result of her gems being misaligned, then that would be the fault of I, her tuner. 
 
 I swiftly fixed Efa's shoulder straps with my other hand and, to check her condition as quickly as I could, placed my hands on her chest.
 
 v22ef0613
 エファ「H-how, is... it?」
 v21cr0940
 クリス「...The gems are definitely vibrating a little too fast...」
 I could feel Efa's life force not only through the hand I had placed on her chest, but through the hand that was tightly grasping mine as well.
 v21cr0941
 クリス「When did this start happening?」
 v22ef0614
 エファ「...Um... some time ago...」
 v21cr0942
 クリス「How long ago was that?
 Was it that time when your chest hurt?」
 v22ef0615
 エファ「...No, it happened when I was...」
 v21cr0943
 クリス「I?」
 v22ef0616
 エファ「―When I was thinking about Your Highness, all of a sudden...」
 v21cr0944
 クリス「(―But that means... no, that couldn't possibly be true...)」
 v21cr0945
 クリス「......I-I'll go call for an engineer right now.」
 v22ef0617
 エファ「Please don't, go... Your Highness... don't leave me alone...」
 v21cr0946
 クリス「I'll be back soon, so please let go of―」
 v22ef0618
 エファ「I am fine. Just touching you like this, Your Highness, is enough to make my heart naturally calm down... it feels as if I am dreaming.」
 
 Upon watching Efa's calm expression, even my own impatience was mysteriously slipping away―
 
 My hand clasping hers, and her hand clasping mine, shall separate no longer.
 v21cr0947
 クリス「...Efa, do you remember?」
 v22ef0619
 エファ「About?」
 v21cr0948
 クリス「That request you asked of me... when you were half awake at that time.」
 I recalled the memory of the time we kissed.
 v22ef0620
 エファ「...Yes, inside my dream, Your Highness... you were very gentle with me.」
 v21cr0949
 クリス「I see.」
 v22ef0621
 エファ「But, I can hardly remember anymore... so...」
 v21cr0950
 クリス「......?」
 v22ef0622a
 エファ「Please, give it to me... one more time.」
 v21cr0951
 クリス「...Efa...」
 There was no reason to refuse her.
 Without hesitation, I pressed my lips against her own, feverish as they were.
 v22ef0623
 エファ「...Nn... nn.」
 Her sweet moan was enough to melt the last of my rationality.
 v22ef0624
 エファ「―Your Highness...」
 v21cr0952
 クリス「......?」
 v22ef0625
 エファ「...Your Highness, you have been suffering alone, all this while.」
 v21cr0953
 クリス「―Efa...」
 v22ef0626
 エファ「I understood that just now. By pressing our lips against each other... I could feel your emotions... flow into me.」
 
 v21cr0954
 クリス「......!」
 v22ef0627
 エファ「If possible, please, share a part of that suffering with me.」
 v22ef0628
 エファ「No matter how dreadful our suffering is, if we bear it together... I'm sure we can...」

 Those words not only saved me from my suffering, but also caused me to surrender my body to impulses that I could no longer hold back.

 After leaving my room, I ran about here and there and everywhere. I've passed by tons of hallways, stairs, and unfamiliar rooms.
 
 I asked all the soldiers I bumped into the address of Dua's house, but they all said they didn't know.
 
 But the last person I asked told me this.

 クリス「―Oh? What a coincidence. I too have something I would like you to hear.」
 
 To report to Milady everything that had happened, I have come to visit her chamber.
 
 Since the topic was what it was, I had asked Efa to leave the room beforehand.

 I understood that she might be feeling ill at ease after Dua's death and Efa's return.
 When I had proposed that a new bodyguard should be assigned to the Princess, she had rejected it with the reason ‘Now is not the time for that.’
 As a result of the Princess's response to that, I had assumed that it would be difficult to speak to her now, but―
 
 It seems that her spirits were not as low today as I had expected.

 The incident in which he caught a glimpse of the Princess's abilities, and was scolded severely by the ruling king for it.

 If I'd been in time, I would have liked to watch Mr. Fabio's performance, but it was already evening by the time I got to the Sienna bus stop.
 
 Since the play was about to end, I refrained from buying a ticket and waited outside.
 
 For some reason, Wakaba had asked me to come to Sienna today.

 Wakaba had said that so confidently, but I wonder if it's actually possible.
 
 Fabio was an eccentric yet popular actor, after all. 
 And his national performance tour was a hot topic at the moment.
 st04_c03
 v04ce0959
 セロ「(―If I meet someone like that, it wouldn't be a surprise if he shuts the door on me...)」
 He's a professional actor who earns a living on stage, after all.
 Going to see a person like that, and asking him if he would perform in our play... that was so unrealistic when I thought about it.

 v03wa0992
 ワカバ「―We have a villain role which he's always wanted, that's the key point.」
 How could Wakaba say something like that so confidently, you ask?
 That was because she had found and showed me a passionate declaration of Fabio's from an interview in a magazine.

 v09fa0040
 ファビ「‘...I've always wanted to play the role of a villain!’」
 Would he really accept based just on that one sentence he'd said?

 All I could think was how rash this behavior was, and the only thing that could help me was this letter of introduction in my bag.
 
 I had even wondered if it might be a letter Wakaba had written herself... or some kind of photograph to blackmail him with.
 
 Still, I came here without opening it. It doesn't seem I can go back and say ‘Sorry, I can't do this’ to Wakaba after coming here.
 
 That's right, since it's come to this, I have no choice but to try my luck.

 Let's go!」
 After finding my resolve, I headed towards the dressing room once the play had ended.

 v04ce0964
 セロ「...Oh, so he went for... dinner?」
 To achieve my goal, I'd waited there nervously for a whole hour, but the person who had come out of the dressing room hadn't been Fabio.
 
  It seemed like he was the first to go back to the dressing room once the performance ended, then headed out to a restaurant, saying ‘I'm going out to eat.’
 
 v04ce0965
 セロ「...Then, can I ask which restaurant...」
 bg19a03
 The member of the troupe whom I spoke with told me that he'd been eating in the same restaurant throughout the run of the performance, so I could probably find him there.
 
 
 Still, despite that, I had only ever seen Mr. Fabio from his photograph in a magazine.
 
 And in that photograph, he'd doffed a feather and looked like some kind of weird missionary.
 
 If I couldn't recognize his face without makeup, will I have to call out for him?
 st04_c07
 v04ce0966
 セロ「...*sigh*...」
 My feet suddenly heavy, I headed for the restaurant Mr. Fabio was in.
 
 Still, the person from the troupe had told me that I wouldn't need to shout his name.
 
 
 He said that I just have to look for a conspicuously dressed person.

 With that in mind, I looked carefully around the dimly lit restaurant.

 v04ce0981

 In the worst case scenario, he would have declined the moment I asked him, so I was already satisfied that he was willing to hear me out.
 
 ...No, I can't settle for that. My goal is to get Mr. Fabio to perform for us.
 
 v09fa0054
 ファビ「Hmm. So, what kind of play is it?」

 While the woman beside him perused the script as well, Mr. Fabio seemed to be deep in thought.

 ev027b
 v09fa0057
 ファビ「...Ein not the villain, eh...」
 That was the main problem.
 Even though Ein wasn't the villain, would he still be willing to accept that role?
 Wakaba had said that Ein still would appear a villain at first, but I don't think Fabio would accept the role just because of that.
 
 In a way, this is almost like tricking him into joining us.
 v09fa0058
 ファビ「So, Valery would be the villain, eh?」
 His reaction didn't seem bad. Still, that doesn't mean that he'll accept.
 
 v09fa0059
 ファビ「This seems interesting, but... give me sixty seconds to think about it.」
 ...Sixty seconds?
  Was this something that he could decide upon in such a short time?
 I got nervous.
  What should I do if he refuses...
 With that in mind, I noticed the letter of introduction sticking out from the bag that I had opened to get out the script.
 
 (―No, I should only show it to him if he refuses.)
 「E-excuse me... could you take a look at this?」
 v04ce0984

 If I don't show him this while I can before he refuses, it will be too late.

 After he agreed to perform, our conversation went smoothly.
 When we shook hands, and I was about to leave, I remembered something―

 I had thought this might be the same character in the play we'd put on in Vermilion.

 To Christina, the Schwester was the very ‘angel’ that blessed her... she wanted to tell her that.

 I calmed down, prepared for our eighth try, and took a deep breath. 
 
 v00an1230
 アンジ「Alright, here we go again...」
 ...Suddenly, at this moment, I thought I felt someone's eyes upon me.
 It wasn't Wakaba, who had been there a while ago.
 v00an1231
 アンジ「(―Who can it be?)」
 I glanced at the audience seating, and saw that though they had been empty before, someone was sitting in one.
 
 v00an1232
 アンジ「(―That person's...)」
 The backlight was upon me, so I couldn't really see the audience clearly.
 I thought of focusing on my acting and continuing to practice, but somehow I was curious.
  So, after squinting... I could finally vaguely tell who that person was.
 v00an1233

 Even though we were in the middle of a rehearsal, I hadn't been able to keep from exclaiming his name.
 Belle followed my gaze, then turned her head and asked me.
 v01be0964
 ベル「...Um, who is that man...?」
 v00an1236
 アンジ「The actor, Fabio Grey. He's famous throughout the country- one of the few men who I recognize.」
 
 Furthermore, I even paid attention to his private life.
 Since he's―
 v00an1237
 アンジ「(―Marion Curie's husband, after all.)」
 I hadn't been able to confess to Lady Marion on that day in the Blue Capital, because I found out that she was already engaged to him.
 
 And now... that person was watching us practice―

  he replied in a voice loud enough for us all to hear, as he stood up.

 Or could it be that Wakaba's well connected in the acting world, and I never knew?

 He had heard about me from his wife, Lady Marion.

 I wasn't sure if I should ask him about it... but in the end, I lost to my curiosity.

 I asked bluntly, without any shame whatsoever.

 After that, we made some awkward conversation.

 Since he didn't have much time, Fabio did not try on the costume and simply took a look at it.
 
 He had said that he needed to go back to Sienna and meet up with the troupe he's performing with for tomorrow's performance.

 If one thinks about it, it's impossible that Wakaba could be connected with someone like that.
  Even if she did, it was only through me and Lady Marion―

 アイン「(―The Lady's memories are flowing into Efa...)」
 When Christina Dorn had succeeded the throne, I had begun serving the young Princess as her steward.
 The Dorn family was formed from the marriage of the Red and Blue nobility, and the royalty of this country shouldered the responsibility of lineal succession.
 There were two reasons for that.
 The first was that as a prestigious royal family, they must continue to be of the blood of both Red and Blue, and remain a symbol of peace between the two greater kingdoms. 
 
 While the second was―
 ein_d06
 v24ei0748
 アイン「(―Through a special Memory Stone, the knowledge of dolls from the previous generation shall be passed onwards to the next generation...)」
 
 That is the ‘Dorn's Memory’ that is renowned within the kingdom, the gem upon the pendant that the Princess wears at all times.
 
 ein_d03
 v24ei0749
 アイン「(―And, a similar gem to that one...)」
 ...Had been present in Efa's shoe.
 black450
 bg59a01
 v24ei0750
 アイン「―When did you notice it?」
 chr_a04
 v21cr0979
 クリス「...When I was in the midst of tuning Efa after she was injured.」
 v24ei0751
 アイン「Then why have you not stayed away from her?」
 chr_a05
 v21cr0980
 クリス「Do you think that I, as a tuner, could do something like that?」
 Setting aside the matter of the Princess's emotions and rationality at that time, it is true abandoning Efa's treatment was definitely not an option to the White Kingdom.
 
 ...Still, by doing nothing and letting the Red Kingdom's ‘Memory Stealer’ gem carry out its plot to duplicate our kingdom's treasure, she has blundered greatly.
 
 Though I wanted to scold the Princess harshly for what she had done, there was no way I could turn back the clock.
 v24ei0752
 アイン「...Let's just leave the past aside for now.」
 chr_a06
 v21cr0981
 クリス「―You're right.」
 The more she longed for Efa, the more memories the gem within Efa would take from her.
 
 ...No, implying that the memories are being stolen is incorrect.
 This process was more similar to replication of memories, in which the gem would copy the information and record it within itself.
 
 Thus, the normal solution for this problem would simply be to remove the gem from Efa's body, but there was one major complication.
 
 During the Lady's tuning, she had realized that Efa's own spirit- originally resident only in her Memory Stone- was now dependent on the Memory Stealer hidden within her shoes.
 
 After losing her wing, Efa began functioning in such a way that her Memory Stone functions require both of those gemstones to be present- therefore separating the two would be no simple task.
 
 v24ei0753
 アイン「...Should we return Efa to the Red Kingdom like this?」
 I suggested to the Lady that we give up doing anything to retrieve the fraction of her memories that had been stolen.
 chr_a04
 v21cr0982
 クリス「As I said earlier, if we let Efa go back as she currently is, it is inevitable that she will cease to function.」
 
 That should be the Red Kingdom's own responsibility. They are the ones who caused this, so it is only proper they should suffer the loss of their kingdom's treasure.
 
 
 
 Still, it was naive to think the Red Kingdom would be anything but deaf to that logic if the matter escalated.
 
 v24ei0754
 アイン「―Then, the only choice left...」
 chr_a06
 v21cr0983
 クリス「Is to seal those memories of mine within Efa and return her. That is the best solution.」
 v24ei0755
 アイン「And what is the failure rate of that tuning process?」
 chr_a04
 v21cr0984
 クリス「To put it bluntly, the success rate is low... but there are no other options available to us.」
 
 Judging from the Lady's expression, it seemed like this would be a difficult operation.
 To succeed, she would have to have a clear understanding of Efa's spiritual structure, and seal off all those memories from their very origin.
 
 chr_a06
 v21cr0985

 Since there's no way I could take a nap like that, I gave up and stared out the window.
 v24ei0766
 アイン「(―The Princess and Efa. They are both part of my life now...)」
 On the other hand, the Princess when she was a child and... Giselle.
 They had both been part of my father, Fritz's, life.
 v24ei0767
 アイン「(―This karma runs in the family, it seems...)」
 My father had said that Giselle was not a doll as masterfully wrought as Efa, but was more like a prototype.
 
 v24ei0768
 アイン「(―At that time, the Lady had yet to succeed the ‘Dorn's Memory,’ but still...)」
 
 When she tuned Giselle, the display impressed the late king greatly with her talents.
 Of course, that went for all of the king's retainers too.
 So as not to let down the anticipation given to her by everyone around her, she took the initiative and kept on tuning Giselle.
 
 As a result, the Princess had herself ventured near the boundaries of life and death... so I had heard.
 
 v24ei0769
 アイン「(―All right, what shall I do about Efa right now?)」
 Should I just leave her to the Lady? Or should I...
 v24ei0770

 Have Efa ‘fall into Hell’ before the worst-case scenario happens?
 Without a doubt, Giselle could not be classified in the same status as the national treasure Efa.

 With those words Coco had said, another possibility came to mind.
 
 I had thought of this whole situation of the Red and Blue with Weiss at the center.
 
 However, that limited my outlook to viewing this kingdom as bound by the circumstances of its creation.
 If I were to think boldly and disregard that principle―

 As he kept asking me questions that seemed to have no point, I realized what Ein was trying to do.
 
 The subject of the questions Ein is asking were slowly... leading the conversation to the matter of my return to the Red Kingdom.

 But, if I told him what he wants to hear right now―
 I will surely regret it for the rest of my life.
 v22ef0647
 エファ「(―Or is this...)」
 Or will this question influence whether I can continue staying in the White Kingdom?
 I did not know much about Ein, but just by considering his viewpoint, I already knew the answer. 
 
 If he really would allow me to stay, that would be like a miracle.
 
 ein_b07

 There is only one answer that can end this meaningless waste of time.
 I will not hesitate, even if the outcome of my words is to be my separation from Her Highness.
 
 v22ef0649
 エファ「(―My feelings are true.)」
 Even if I lie, Her Highness will not praise me.
 My honest answer was motivated not by despair,
 ...but because I clearly understand my own feelings.
 v24ei0789

 The reason for that was because... Ein cares about Her Highness.
 Not only Ein, but Dua did as well.

 If I don't ask him now, I will probably never have another chance to ask again.

 But Ein had no chance to tell her, nor did he need to.

 ein_d07

 ein_d06
 v24ei0806

 Even if we started preparing for war right now, the difference in the military strength of our countries was too great.

 ein_d03

 ein_d07

 ein_d06

 アイン「So Valery had set us up against the Red right from the start.」
 
 
 That man had been planning his actions based on the intent to provoke war with the Red Kingdom all by himself.

 ein_b01
 v24ei0819
 アイン「Regarding the series of events that the White Kingdom has inevitably become involved in up until now―」
 
 As he spoke, many, many unbearable things were told to me. 
 Jussi had asked a craftsman to create a genuine dagger that looked just like the one that was meant to be used on stage.
 That dagger had been swapped with the prop by Hans during the stage preparations, and then ended up in Efa's hands.
 
 ein_b06

 アイン「...If anything had happened at that time, and Efa had dropped that dagger, you would have been in danger, Milady.」

 My heart started beating faster when Efa became the topic of conversation.
 I had told Ein about the Memory Stealer Stone.
 But there was one more stone― the Control Stone that manipulates Efa― which I have yet to tell anyone about. 
 
 If Ein mentions anything about the Control Stone in this report―
 
 bg53a01

 Why did he want to involve our White Kingdom in such a conflict?
 v21cr1010
 クリス「(―Which means, the person who inserted the Control Stone into Efa must have been...)」
 The smirk I had seen on Valery's face when Efa was holding the dagger...

 Within my mind, I solved the puzzle of a plan Ein had not been able to see.

 I was not well versed in politics, and to help me understand the situation, Ein gave me a summary of the important points.
 
 
 The Red Kingdom claimed that the ‘assassination attempt by the Red Representative’ had been plotted by Blew.
 
 
 
 While on the other side, The Blue Kingdom insisted that ‘the incident at the rehearsal’ had been plotted by Cardinal.
 
 
 Both sides had proposed an alliance to us at the same time, ‘to protect the White Kingdom,’ or so they claimed.

 And then Ein told me that the Blue Kingdom had proposed that the Red Kingdom's treasure, Efa, should be sent over to them― due to the reasoning that she was a ‘threatening object.’

 Of course, this was an important job for me as a tuner.
 Efa had lost a wing in shielding me from the attack, and I had been spending these days tuning her, telling her that it was for purpose of healing.
 
 black450
 But in actual fact, at this moment, Efa have no idea of the main reason that I have been performing tuning on her.
 
 efa_g06
 v21cr1032
 クリス「(―Within Efa's body, there is two Memory Stones.)」
 One of them was Efa's original stone.
 And another one of them had been inserted inside her as part of the Red Kingdom's plot.
 Since we were too late in realizing the presence of the other Memory Stone, Efa had become dependent on the two gemstones for her functions.
 
 And when that second Memory Stone absorbs a certain amount of memories from me... Efa will not be Efa anymore.
 
 The more feelings I have for Efa,
 and the more feelings Efa had for me,
 the more the density of that second Memory Stone will increase.
 And as its density increases, the speed at which my memories flow into it will be accelerated.
 
 When that happens, Efa's body will not be able to sustain the burden it creates, and will break.
 But even if I stopped tuning her right now, and sent her away from my side, she would still cease functioning, unable to bear the loneliness of not being with me.
 
 There was only one way to save her―
 black450
 v21cr1033
 クリス「(―That is to seal my memories from her.)」
 If I do that, as long as I can endure my longing for Efa, then this problem would be solved. 
 
 That's why, to make that happen, I have to keep performing the necessary tuning on her.
 Before Efa approached her limit, I had tried countless times to seal her memories of me, all to no avail.
 
 ...But now.

 In terms of days, she has only a day or two remaining.
 When that time has passed, Efa will...

 クリス「(―Furthermore...)」
 I, too, could not live without Efa.
 How can I save both Efa and myself?
 black450
 v21cr1036
 クリス「(―No.)」
 There was no need for me to be saved.
 v21cr1037
 クリス「(―As long as Efa is.)」
 ...At that moment.
 I realized the one and only solution.

 To save as many lives as possible, every single one I can, that was the duty I have been entrusted with.

 クリス「...Efa, do you still remember your lines?」
 v22ef0664
 エファ「Eh?」
 Unclear of the intentions of Her Highness's sudden question, I blinked in confusion.
 But since she mentioned ‘lines,’ I understood that she was referring to the ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings.’
 
 v22ef0665
 エファ「Yes, I still remember.」
 chr_a02
 v21cr1039
 クリス「That is well.」
 v22ef0666
 エファ「What do you mean?」
 The ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ was the play that was supposed to be performed at the memorial ceremony, but thanks to that incident on that day, I will never have a chance to perform it again.

 クリス「Now, I shall teach you the purpose of that. Let us head to the court together.」
 v22ef0667

 Without understanding what was going on, I was escorted by Her Highness out of her chamber and we began walking down the corridor.

 クリス「We three spent so much effort practicing together for the play, but in the end, we didn't have a chance to perform.」

 エファ「...Indeed.」
  It was exactly as Her Highness had said.
 All we had done was a rehearsal, not the real performance.
 v22ef0670
 エファ「(―And at that rehearsal, I lost one of my wings.)」
 Still, due to the injury I suffered at that time, I had the chance to become closer to Her Highness.
 chr_a05

 クリス「Or is it that I should not... speak to you of the play?」
 v22ef0671

 クリス「...Then, will you listen to my selfish request?」
 v22ef0672

 v22ef0673
 エファ「...Something similar?」
 chr_a02
 v21cr1046
 クリス「Yes, please let me borrow a little of your time.」
 v22ef0674
 エファ「...Sure.」
 I felt that there was something different about her from the usual Princess I knew. 
 black450
 But, what was different today... I could not identify.
 bg53a01
 After finally arriving at the court, which was empty, we walked together to the center of the room.
 
 chr_a01
 v21cr1047
 クリス「...There, we have arrived.」
 v22ef0675
 エファ「...Yes, but what are we going to do here?」
 v21cr1048
 クリス「......」
 Her Highness did not answer my question, but only stared at me in silence.
 v22ef0676
 エファ「...?」
 bg53a01
 And then, suddenly―
 chr_b06
 v21cr1049
 クリス「Oh Angel's Egg, when shall you be able to spread your wings?」
  Her Highness spoke.
 v22ef0677
 エファ「...My wings?」
 v21cr1050
 クリス「―Indeed. The symbolic wings of an angel. I ask you, when shall you be able to obtain those?」
 v22ef0678
 エファ「(―Her tone of voice is different from usual.
 Could it be that she...)」
 bg53a01
 That scene from ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ reawakened inside my mind.
 That's right, isn't this the same scene Her Highness and Coco was in?
 v22ef0679
 エファ「...Will you bestow them upon me, My Queen?」
 chr_a04
 v21cr1051
 クリス「I must see if you are worthy. If you can prove yourself worthy... I shall bestow them upon you immediately.」
 As I thought.
  This surprise that Her Highness had sprung upon me was none other than a scene in the play. 
 v22ef0680
 エファ「...Prove myself.」
 chr_a01
 v21cr1052
 クリス「That is so. If you do not wish to stay an egg forever, then do not forget.」
 v22ef0681
 エファ「...Yes.」
 chr_a05
 As I spoke that line, I glanced Her Highness's face, and noticed that a lonesome smile floated upon her lips.
 v22ef0682
 エファ「...Um, Your Highness. Could it be that I have mistaken the lines?」
 chr_a01
 v21cr1053
 クリス「No, Efa. Your lines match the script.」
 v22ef0683
 エファ「Eh?」
 v21cr1054
 クリス「The Angel's Egg had a line answering ‘yes’ just now, did she not?」
 v22ef0684
 エファ「...Yes.」
 v21cr1055
 クリス「At that part, you made a little mistake.」
 v22ef0685
 エファ「What do you mean?」
 I had no idea what mistake she meant to point out.
 chr_a02
 v21cr1056
 クリス「...Ufufu. Then I shall help you remember. Who, in fact, was the Angel's Egg performing on stage?」
 
 v22ef0686
 エファ「Well, that was Coco...」
 chr_a01
 v21cr1057
 クリス「And what is Coco's usual response?」
 v22ef0687
 エファ「...Ah!」
 ...So that's what she meant!
 I had replied ‘Yes,’ as was the line within the script that I had read. 
 But, when Coco was playing the role, she would have said―
 v22ef0688
 エファ「...It should be ‘Kay,’ right?」
 chr_a02
 v21cr1058
 クリス「Indeed, quite right. Still, I am surprised that you manage to memorize the lines of the Angel's Egg.」
 
 v22ef0689
 エファ「When I practice many times with a partner for the play, I memorize most of the lines in their script too.」
 
 chr_a03
 v21cr1059
 クリス「...Then, did you memorize the lines of the queen I am performing as― Margaret Dorn?」
 
 v22ef0690
 エファ「Yes, of course!」
 chr_a01
 v21cr1060
 クリス「Which means, if the time comes... would you be able to stand in for me?」
 v22ef0691
 エファ「...Yes.」
 For an instance, it seemed that Her Highness's expression had grown cloudy, but was it just my imagination?
 v21cr1061
 クリス「...If that is so, how nice it would be if I had memorized the lines of the angel you're performing as.」
 
 v22ef0692
 エファ「―Why?」
 chr_a02
 v21cr1062
 クリス「If I did, then we might be able to swap roles with each other, and surprise everyone.」
 v22ef0693
 エファ「...Aah!」
  That definitely made sense.
 v21cr1063
 クリス「I, as the angel...」
 chr_a04
 v22ef0694
 エファ「And I, as Queen Margaret.」
 We laughed together as we stated our reversed roles, in a rhythmical fashion.
 
 chr_a01
 v21cr1064
 クリス「...Well then, should we begin the real performance that is meant for us alone?」
 v22ef0695
 エファ「...Yes!」
 It's just as well if there isn't even a single person as our audience.
 Performing together with Her Highness was a delight enough in itself.
 v21cr1065
 クリス「...Efa, does it matter to you which scene we perform?」
 v22ef0696
 エファ「Not at all.」
  We had done a warm-up just now.
 And the lines of the script had already fully awakened inside my head.
 chr_a04
 v21cr1066
 クリス「Then, let us begin...」
 chr_a06
 Her Highness took a deep breath,
 v21cr1067
 クリス「...If so, then please kill me.」
  and said.
 I never thought that it would be this scene that she wanted to perform. I was shocked stiff―
 chr_a01
 v21cr1068
 クリス「...Come on, continue.」
 But since Her Highness had asked for it, I quickly summoned the scene to my mind.
 v22ef0697
 エファ「―I understand.」
 v22ef0698
 エファ「(―At this moment, I would fetch the dagger hanging upon the wall.)」
 And then, I shall push the queen's body down and sit on top of her, but...
 chr_a02
 v21cr1069
 クリス「I suppose there is no need for you to ride me like a pony.」
 Her Highness said with a laugh, as she beckoned me to her side.
 v22ef0699
 エファ「...You're right.」
 I too laughed as I stood before Her Highness, and then waited for her next line.
 chr_a01
 v21cr1070
 クリス「Come, think of nothing but to stab me.」
 v22ef0700
 エファ「―I cannot do that.」
 v21cr1071
 クリス「Why is that?
 Did you not say that you understood just now? Come, think of nothing...」
 
 v22ef0701
 エファ「I cannot.」

 クリス「Do you not desire freedom?」

 v21cr1073
 クリス「Do you not wish to live as a human?」
 v22ef0703
 エファ「Dolls can never become human.」
 This performance for the two of us alone was proceeding well.
  Her Highness had not misspoken a single line of hers, and I was slightly impressed.
 v21cr1074
 クリス「If I tell you that if you kill me, you could become human... then what would you do?」
 
 v22ef0704
 エファ「...I...」
 chr_a05
 v21cr1075
 クリス「Don't you want to become human?
  The one who said to me that they wished to be human... that was you, was it not?」
 I couldn't help but to wonder that myself.
 v22ef0705
 エファ「(―I don't mind even if I can't become human. As long as I can stay by Her Highness's side.)」
 ...That is what I truly thought.
 chr_a04
 v21cr1076
 クリス「Are you disobeying my order?」
 v22ef0706
 エファ「...If that is truly your order...」
 v22ef0707
 エファ「(―The climax is near.)」
 There are just a few more lines from Her Highness―
 black450
 v22ef0708
 エファ「......Eh!?」
 I was shocked as Her Highness suddenly offered the dagger from that time to me.
 
 bg53a01
 v22ef0709
 エファ「T-this is... from...」
 chr_a01
 v21cr1077
 クリス「...That's right. Now, take it...」

 エファ「...B-but...」
 chr_a04
 v21cr1078
 クリス「Then, obey my order. Oh Angel, come, kill me, grasp your freedom with your own hands, and fly with your wings spread.」
 As Her Highness said that line, I was already holding the dagger in my hands.
 I had no idea why I was holding the dagger,
 v22ef0711
 エファ「...Y-Your Highness?」
  and when I tried to ask her―
 chr_a05
 v21cr1079
 クリス「...Efa, just a bit more and the play will end.」
  She said with a sad smile.
 v22ef0712
 エファ「...Yes, that is so, but...」
 At that time, there had been something inside my body, whispering to me.
 black450
 ―Kill Her Highness... is what it had said.
 ...And then,
 v21cr1080
 クリス「Please... kill me.」
 Just like that whisper, I could hear Her Highness's voice.
 v22ef0713
 エファ「...W-what kind of joke is this?」
 I truly believed, that in the end, this was just a performance of that play.
 But even so, I could feel a surge of energy inside my body,
 
 waiting earnestly for the next line.
 bg53a01

  How many ‘Memory Stones’... do you currently have?」
 v22ef0716

 v21cr1084
 クリス「I fear you currently have two Memory Stones.」
 v22ef0717
 エファ「Eh?」
 chr_a05
 v21cr1085
 クリス「The first is the Memory Stone you had originally, and the other one is a high-density gem that absorbs the knowledge and memories of humans.」
 
 chr_a06
 v21cr1086
 クリス「And it seems that the person who hid that high density gem inside your body desired my knowledge of the doll arts.」
 
 v22ef0718
 エファ「Your Highness's... knowledge?
 But why me?」
 chr_a01
 v21cr1087
 クリス「That's because you are the doll who has been by my side all the time, before and after the ceremony.」
 
 v22ef0719
 エファ「...So, having this gem means...」
 chr_a05

 クリス「It's a stone that will absorb other people's memories whenever they touch, and whenever they long for each other as well.」

 Unable to finish that sentence, she abruptly moved on to a new one.

 クリス「That gem shall disregard your limits, its host body, and continue to absorb my memories.」

 Her Highness shut her eyes, and shook her head from left to right.

  that the tip was pointed at her chest.

 アイン「...W-what is this!?」
  Upon entering the court, I was shocked beyond words.
 ev910b
 Efa was sitting silently on the carpet.
 And within her lap, she cradled the fallen Princess.
 Confronted by this scene I could never imagined, I ran towards the two.

 v24ei0852
 アイン「Milady!」
 ev910a
 This is not the time to keep a respectful distance.
 v24ei0853
 アイン「Milady, what are you doing...」
 Prepared for any rebuke that may come, I reached out to the Lady's shoulder―
 v24ei0854
 アイン「(―K-kuh!)」
 And I then realized that my words would never reach her.
 
 v24ei0855
 アイン「Why, why... did it come to this so soon...」
 black450
 No...
 If only, if only I could have informed the Lady sooner, this would not have happened.
 ...I never would have thought that the Lady would choose the path of suicide together with Efa.
 v22ef0752
 エファ「―E-Ein.」
 v24ei0856
 アイン「Efa!
 You were alive?!」

 efa_g07
 Efa, who had earlier shown no signs of life, silently turned her face to me and nodded.
 And then, she murmured,
 v22ef0753
 エファ「...I mustn't die yet.」
 
 v24ei0857
 アイン「What in the world happened?」
 v22ef0754
 エファ「―I, I... I killed Her Highness with my own hands.」
 v24ei0858
 アイン「...E-Efa!?」
 For a moment, upon hearing that confession, I felt the urge to tighten my hands around her neck.
 ...But there was no way I could do that before the Princess's tranquil face.
 v24ei0859
 アイン「...Is that true?」
 v22ef0755
 エファ「Yes, I... ki... killed Her High...」
 v24ei0860
 アイン「Tell the truth to me. Spare no detail.」
 v22ef0756
 エファ「Her Highness... asked me to hold the dagger... and perform the play with her... once more.」
 
 v22ef0757
 エファ「Her Highness knew of a gem that was hidden inside my shoe... and made me point the dagger at her chest―」
 Efa begun detailing the inserted Control Stone. \nIt was set with two conditions: ‘during a rehearsal performance for the memorial ceremony’ and ‘hearing a specific line of the script as a signal.’
 When these conditions were met, Efa would be forced to kill the Princess with her own hands. 
 
 After discovering those conditions through tuning, the Princess used them and made Efa end her life.
 
 v22ef0758
 エファ「―And now, Her Highness... will remain inside my Memory Stone.」
 efa_g04
 v22ef0759
 エファ「I didn't want... to be saved like this...」
 The facts of which she spoke were filled with sorrow... and emptiness.
 efa_g06
 However, if even I give up right now, then everything will be over.
 v24ei0861
 アイン「...Please forgive me.」
 I removed the ‘Dorn's Memory’ from the Princess's neck and placed it in Efa's hands.
 efa_g04
 v22ef0760
 エファ「Isn't this... Her Highness's most precious possession, and that of Weiss as well? ...Why are you giving it to me?」
 
 v24ei0862
 アイン「Take that, and get in the carriage that I've prepared. Then leave this kingdom and head for Cardinal.」
 
 
 v22ef0761
 エファ「Are you telling me to hand over the gemstone that Her Highness left behind to Cardinal?!」
 
 
 v24ei0863
 アイン「No, I'm not. I have a blood relative in the Red Kingdom, so head there first.」
 v24ei0864
 アイン「After meeting with that person, he will take you south out of Cardinal.」
 
 
 efa_g04
 v22ef0762
 エファ「...But that's...」
 v24ei0865
 アイン「I had considered arranging for the Lady, together with you and Coco, to escape to ‘another kingdom’ out of the Red and Blue's reach.」
 
 To a kingdom far southeast of us, a kingdom below Cardinal committed to neutrality.
 
 I had sent a letter asking them to protect the Lady and her dolls if the situation arose, intending it to be the last resort.
 
 v24ei0866
 アイン「I can not promise that you will get there safely... but, I do believe that you should take the risk if there is a chance.」
 
 v24ei0867
 アイン「―If we hand over the ‘Dorn's Memory’ now, you know what will happen, right?」
 efa_g06
 v22ef0763
 エファ「...Yes, Her Highness's memories have taught me many things of it.」
 v24ei0868
 アイン「Alright, I'll escort you to the carriage, then I'll go get Coco―」
 efa_g04
 v22ef0764
 エファ「Please wait, Ein.」
 Efa was staring at me earnestly.
 v22ef0765
 エファ「If I attempt to escape, then Cardinal will surely be able to catch me before I succeed, don't you think so?」
 
 
 v24ei0869
 アイン「...Of course, I proposed it knowing that from the beginning. That's why it is only a possibility...」
 v22ef0766
 エファ「Then shall we do it in a way that increases that possibility as much as can be done?」
 
 v24ei0870
 アイン「What do you mean by that?」
 efa_g06
 v22ef0767
 エファ「...I shall not run away, and Coco shall take the carriage holding the ‘Dorn's Memory’ together with ‘Her Highness's Memory.’」
 
 v24ei0871
 アイン「...Aren't the Lady's memories inside the Memory Stone that has already become a part of you?」
 
 v22ef0768
 エファ「Yes, that's why I will be together with Coco, inside the Memory Stone that is also ‘Her Highness's Memory.’」
 v24ei0872
 アイン「Wait! Then, what about the other you in your doll body...」
 
 efa_g04
 v22ef0769
 エファ「...As long as I can sleep together with Her Highness inside the Memory Stone, that will be enough.」
 Efa wanted to save the Princess.
 That's why, she was willing to live on without a body.
 ―And she's right, it would increase the possibility of success if we were to take into account Cardinal's pursuit―
 v24ei0873
 アイン「(―We're already in a fight against time...）」
 v24ei0874
 アイン「Efa, you intend to buy some time before the pursuit by leaving your body behind, right?」
 efa_g06
 v22ef0770
 エファ「Yes. Even if Her Highness's Memory is taken from me, I can still last for a while.」
 Her reply, without hesitation, displayed her immense resolve. 
 Her decision was already made, and there was nothing I could say to change it.
 v24ei0875
 アイン「...Then, I too have a suggestion.」
 v22ef0771
 エファ「What might it be?」
 v24ei0876
 アイン「You are a fine actress, are you not?」
 v22ef0772
 エファ「...Yes, I am. But what about it?」
 v24ei0877
 アイン「Then, tell them that ‘the one who murdered the Princess was Ein Ronberg.’」
 efa_g04
 v22ef0773
 エファ「...Eh?」
 v24ei0878
 アイン「...If you wish to stay in the castle rather than escape with the carriage, I want you to tell that to the people who shall come here later.」
 
 v22ef0774
 エファ「But that's a lie. The one who caused Her Highness's death was I.」

 I spoke quietly to Her Highness, who lay upon the bed at my side.
 v22ef0776
 エファ「For the sake of protecting your memories, Your Highness, I shall be performing a final play.」
 
 v22ef0777
 エファ「It seems that Ein has personally sent a messenger to the high officials from the Red and Blue whom he is acquainted with.」
 v22ef0778
 エファ「―In the letters held by those messengers is written the evidence of those kingdoms' treachery.」
 v22ef0779
 エファ「And if they disobey even one of the terms proposed, their acts shall be made known...」
 
 
 And if that happens, it is likely that the people of Weiss will hold a deep grudge against the Red and Blue afterwards.
 v22ef0780
 エファ「...Of course, it is difficult to know whether those terms will be accepted... which is what Ein himself said.」
 v22ef0781
 エファ「But even so, if it goes well... then all this can be settled with a minimum of further damage.」
 And for that cause, I must perform until the final moment.

 This is our final meeting, yet there is still much I wish to say.
 But, if I say anymore than this, I will...
 coc_c01
 v02co1084
 ココ「Ah, right―. Hey, Efa―」

 Coco came to my side and stood on her tiptoes, trying to reach my ears.

 v02co1085
 ココ「You know, I can eat peppers and carrots, already!」
  When I crouched down for her, she whispered that to me.
 v22ef0786
 エファ「...!」
 Ever since I lost one of my wings, I had never had the chance to have a meal together with her.
 And during that time, Coco had been fighting her battle with carrots and peppers―

 v02co1086
 ココ「Now, you're the first one to know―」

 The door closed, leaving no one but me and Her Highness in the room.
 No, that was not quite right.

 Only our bodies remained in this room.
 We're already together in Coco's hands, in the form of ‘Her Highness's Memory,’ alongside the ‘Dorn's Memory’.
 
 I did not know how long I could last with only my original Memory Stone, but I could feel with my body that it would not be long.

 I must perform the act that Ein had depended on me for until my last breath.

 That was the play Ein had prepared.
 ―The princess was murdered by Ein. He took the treasure and fled.
 Anyone who hears this will think that everything was Ein's doing.
 Reciting this line to the people that entered this room was my final performance.
 
 However, before the curtain is lifted.

 エファ「...At least I know that you are in truth a kind person.」
 When he had departed just now, I had murmured some words as I gazed at his back.
 ―Ein Ronberg, I'll leave the rest to you.

 coc_j05
 v02co1093

 v24ei0893
 アイン「Where did Dua kiss you?」

 v02co1099
 ココ「Over here―, my forehead―」
 Coco pointed towards the spot with both of her hands.
 I could somehow understand what Dua had been feeling at that time.

 ―Farewell, Coco.
 SE32b
 v02co1101a
 ココ「Ein―, I haven't―, said bye-bye, yet―」
 After seeing the carriage depart, I straightened my collar.
 All that remains is to wish for Coco's safety, and...
 sv913a
 ―Efa's acting.
 black450
 I prayed that the messenger I had sent to the two kingdoms' military camp had been able to safely transfer the message.
 
 sv920a
 v24ei0897
 アイン「Still about an hour until the promised time, eh?」
 At the end of the letter was written that when the two kingdoms' soldiers were deployed near the border to face each other, ‘the traitor who had killed the Princess,’ Ein, would appear and they are to attack him. 
 
 
 This way, ‘retribution upon the traitor’ shall become the ‘great justice’ needed to justify the Red and Blue having deployed their armies, and will prevent open war.
 
 As long as I don't give them time to think and investigate, the high officials of the Red and Blue that I knew... will act according to the path that shall allow them to reconcile.
 
 v24ei0898
 アイン「(―I don't expect everything will definitely go according to my plans, but...)」
 Even so, this way, a path in which meaningless blood need not be shed is open.
 There is only one regret that I have, and that is―
 v24ei0899
 アイン「...I will not have the chance to see the future of Weiss.」
 
 
 But that would be a luxury a steward who failed to save the Princess hardly deserves.
 v24ei0900
 アイン「...Alright, it's about time I prepared myself.」
 Just like how Dua had protected Efa.
 I shall protect this kingdom and Coco's future.

 That is I, Ein Ronberg's... final role.

 The man himself appeared in the area where the Red and Blue's

 Princess Christina Dorn. Immediately, the two armies engaged him. 
 And at that moment, his final words were―
  ‘Let all the sins be upon me’.

 One by one, our fingers released from each other, and I placed my hand upon her brow.

 The increase in her body temperature that I could feel was not caused by any abnormalities.

 クリス「I understand, Efa. You... just feel uneasy, right?」
 v22ef0797
 エファ「...Yes. Even I don't understand what is happening to myself.」
 Her cheeks flushed red, and Efa shifted her eyes away.
 The urge to tease her arose in me, and I said,
 v21cr1130
 クリス「But... your heart might be beating much faster than mine.」
 
 v22ef0798
 エファ「...Eh?」
 v21cr1131
 クリス「Perhaps I can feel the difference in our heartbeats from your temperature.」
 While tracing my fingers along Efa's lovely skin, I searched for the location of her Sense Stone.
 Realizing that it was spread out throughout her body,
  I gently pressed my forehead against Efa's chest.

 v21cr1134
 クリス「I-is that so?」
 Could it be that I'm the one with a fever instead?
 No, that can't be right. She was the one who told me that her body seemed unwell.
 Thus, as if searching for a reason to justify my excuse, my hands roamed Efa's body, searching for a place where she was warmer than I.

 Now that she mentioned it, I noticed that the hand that had previously let go of hers had joined with it again without my notice.
 
 v21cr1138
 クリス「......」
 Without saying a single word, I responded to her question by squeezing her hand in mine firmly.

 Understanding what I meant with just that, Efa silently closed her eyes.
  I, too, slid my face down to her waist and silently buried my face there.

 When I stopped moving as she had asked, Efa gently placed her left hand atop of my head.
 
 And then, in a slow and relaxed rhythm, she stroked my hair.

 There was no need for her to apologize for such a simple matter.

 Efa gently pushed her fingers into my hair.

 And silently, moved them towards my hair―

 A numbing, yet sweet sensation crawled over my body.
 v22ef0812

 It was not pain that Efa had caused me, but a gentle pleasure born of her affection.

 I never imagined how pleasant it could feel, just to have her brush my hair. 
 
 v22ef0813
 エファ「Your Highness, you sound like you're in pain...」
 v21cr1147
 クリス「...No, that's not it, Efa.」
 For the sake of explaining to Efa, who was looking at me with a worried expression,
  I straightened up and placed my hand on her cheek.
 v21cr1148
 クリス「I'm sure you'll understand if I do this.」
 I slid my fingers behind Efa's ears, and pressed them against the back of her neck softly.

 And then, gently and carefully so as not to tug upon the hair between my fingers, I stroked her.

 I adjusted the rhythm of my exhalation, letting the warmth of our breathing tickle each other's noses.

 I shifted my position a little, and pressed my lips against hers in a sideway manner.

 エファ「Mmm, mmh... mm.」
 Whenever I exhaled, her back arched. And whenever I sought to inhale, her lips chased after mine, not giving them the slightest moment of rest.
 
 Overjoyed by Efa's reaction, I hugged her tightly.

 エファ「...Y-Your, High, ness...」
 Efa had given me, and only me, the key to her heart.
 She had given me, and only me, the right to know her body.
 She had been waiting for me, all this while.
 Compared to all she has done for me, what can I do for her?

 エファ「Ah, t-that's... nn!」
 As I gently poked Efa's nipple, her body trembled―
 v21cr1155
 クリス「...I'm sure you understand how much your heart is pounding, yes?」
 
 Her ragged breathing was attested to by the rise and fall of her chest.
  As she saw that with her own eyes, Efa's face grew a deeper shade of crimson.
 v22ef0822
 エファ「...U-um... Will I, really be... all right like this?」
 Efa shut her eyes, trying to preserve her rationality in self-imposed darkness.
 However, I did not want her to take her eyes off me for even the slightest moment.

 クリス「If you keep your eyes closed, then I shall be sad.」
 Efa is truly kind.

 And the evidence was that she immediately opened her eyes.

  and told her.

 In that knowledge, I decided to impose more of my affection upon her.
 v21cr1169
 クリス「(―Efa probably never knew about this.)」
 That among the senses that her body carries, there is something like this.

 クリス「...Relax. If you don't...」

 Though she had no experience with anything of this sort, she would actually feel embarrassed.
 
 Is that her natural instinct?
 Or―

 With a little force, I buried my face against Efa's neck, then sucked upon it as firmly as I could.

 Though my head was swimming, I somehow managed to catch Efa's body as it fell towards me.
 
 As our heat escaped to the bedsheet bit by bit, I hold her body firmly with in arms, rubbed my cheek against hers and planted a kiss upon her forehead.

 クリス「......Ah.」
 Efa raised her hair and exposed her neck to me, where I saw the ‘mark’ I'd made when I got excited earlier.
 
 And I thought that I'd done it on a place that wasn't conspicious―
 But when she took a deep breath with her hair down, the mark was still somewhat visible.

 クリス「(―If I touch her right now, I will...)」
 I will make the same mistake I had before.
 This is just tuning, I'm doing this for Efa's sake... While deceiving myself with those words, I had proceeded to do things that crossed the line.
 
 
 Efa was a precious doll the Red Kingdom had placed in my care,
 and yet, I failed to moderate my emotions and lusted for her.
 On the other hand, Efa had showed no displeasure at that sort of tuning, and accepted everything I did to her...
 
 No, I mustn't put the blame on her.
 This is a sin committed by I, out of loneliness, via the abuse of my authority.

 クリス「(―A forbidden relationship between a tuner, and a doll...)」
 Amidst my sighs, I stared at Efa's face. She seemed truly happy as she slept.
 
 She was so honest, kind and pure... yet I did not believe that I had tainted her.
 Rather, I actually felt glad to have made her mine―

 With a dignified voice, the princess turned her back towards me.
 ...That was evidence of the trust she had in me.
  For her, I felt as if I could do anything.
 v22ef0872
 エファ「Yes, Your Highness.」
 I quietly reached for the laces of her dress, crossing behind her neck.
 And then, as carefully as I could, I released the knots. The snow-white expanse of her skin was bared before my eyes, and I was overcome by the sight.

 エファ「(―What a lovely back...)」
 All she was doing was undressing, and yet she emitted an aura of elegance and class.

 Is it because she's a human and I'm a doll? Or is it something else?
 v22ef0874

 I can't do something as unforgivable as comparing myself to the Princess.
 Though I never said those insolent thoughts, but thinking them was proof I'm a fool who knows not her place.

 Thus, after preparing myself to be scolded, I confessed.

  makes my heart beat faster, just as if it were my first time holding them.

 v21cr1270
 クリス「...There is something I must apologize to you for.」
 efa_e05
 v22ef0927
 エファ「...Apologize? For what?」
 Facing Efa, whose eyes were wide open in wonder, I slowly drew closer to her face.
 v21cr1271
 クリス「For what I am about to do to you.」
 v22ef0928
 エファ「What might that be?」
 Efa blinked her eyes repeatedly in confusion.
 But I saw no sign of apprehension or displeasure within them.
 And that is a matter of course.
 If she were to resist, I would stop immediately.
 No matter how much I desire her, I have no intention of forcing her to do anything she doesn't want to.
 However, Efa has accepted my desire.
 She has accepted it, knowing that my actions go well beyond the act of tuning.

 エファ「Your Highness...?」
 A tear slowly flowed down Efa's cheek.
 v21cr1272
 クリス「...Efa, are you crying?」
 v22ef0930
 エファ「No, you are the one who is crying... Your Highness.」
 As Efa's hand touched my cheek, only then did I realize it.
 I realized... that I was crying, just as she was.
 v21cr1273
 クリス「What's wrong with us both, I wonder? What is so sorrowful that our tears fall?」

 v22ef0931
 エファ「I don't know, but, Your Highness...」
 v22ef0932
 エファ「―Don't we shed tears at times when we are overjoyed as well?」
 v21cr1274
 クリス「...That is so. Does that mean we're... happy right now?」
 At the very moment those words left my mouth, I realized how foolish that question was.
 If I asked her whether she is happy right now, there's no doubt that she would answer that she is.
 efa_e03
 v22ef0933
 エファ「Yes, I'm happy. Since I can be with Your Highness, whom I like more than anyone.」
 v21cr1275
 クリス「(―Oh, Efa...)」
 I wanted to lose myself in the sweetness of her words.
 I'm happy. We're happy. That is not a falsehood.
 I was truly delighted, from the bottom of my heart, that I was able to live with Efa.
 ...However, I felt just as sad.
 There are no limits to my desire for Efa.
 Being with her puts my heart at rest.
 ...And she too desires me, the same way I do her.
 It's not that I have forgotten my initial purpose. 
 I want to save Efa, no matter what the cost!
 And yet, I knew not how I shall sever this relationship with her―
 I cannot turn back, and no longer can I see the light guiding me along the path ahead.
 v21cr1276
 クリス「You mustn't... Efa, you mustn't desire me so.」
 I shut my eyes and spoke those words, but they were wrong.
 It's not that Efa desired me. 
 I was the one who could not let her go.
 efa_e04
 v22ef0934
 エファ「Your Highness, please don't speak of such sad things.」
 Efa gently caressed my cheeks and wiped away my tears.
 efa_e01
 v22ef0935
 エファ「I like you, Your Highness.」
 As Efa said that, I was reminded of those words from when she had been dreaming.
 The words that I made her say while she was dreaming.
 The words that I made her say because I wanted to hear them.
 The words that were born from that desire of mine.
 v21cr1277
 クリス「Efa... you are mistaken.」
 v22ef0936
 エファ「...I am not.」
 As kindly as she could, she denied my statement directly, with eyes that shone with honesty.
 efa_e03
 v22ef0937
 エファ「I desire you... of my own will, Your Highness.」
 Efa's face drew near, and then she gently pressed her lips to mine.
 v22ef0938
 エファ「There is not the slightest thing false about the feelings that I have for you, Your Highness.」
 v21cr1278
 クリス「...Efa.」
 How should I reply to those words of her, which were so very warm?
 Should I erase everything of mine from her Memory Stone, even if I must force her?
 v21cr1279
 クリス「(―I can't do it...)」
 If I really proceed with such a harsh method, there's a chance that Efa will never awaken again.
 If that happened, not only will she be bereft of all her memories, she would not even have a future.
 ...What should I do, then?
 v21cr1280
 クリス「(―The alternative is...)」
 I thought as swiftly as I could.
 Not taking my memories from her by force, but giving them to her.
 Not taking from her, but giving all of myself to her.
 
 
 v21cr1281
 クリス「(―A difficult method...)」
 Putting into practice a method that has only just sprung to mind is too rash.
 ...However, if I can save Efa with it...
 v21cr1282
 クリス「...Efa, come a little closer.」
 efa_c01
 v22ef0939
 エファ「...Yes.」
 Without the slightest hesitation, she came over just as I wished.
 I wished to save Efa, whom I desire so. 
 And for that sake, I took one step forward.
 For whether this is the right thing to do or not... I have not the time to worry about that.

 クリス「...You're so cute, Efa―」
 Our bare skin pressed directly against one another, without a single scrap of cloth to cover it.
 This was not like before, when only I had removed my dress.
 Right now, I needed our bodies to be as close as possible, and our hearts as one.
 v21cr1284
 クリス「Your skin is so smooth.」
 v22ef0940
 エファ「It doesn't compare to yours, Your Highness.」
 All the tuning I have performed on her to date has made me aware of every single thing about Efa.
 Her hair, her cheeks, her lips.
 Her small breasts... her womanhood far below.
 However, all that was from the regular process of tuning.
 This is the first time I'm tuning her beyond what is necessary, as one who desired her, and was desired by her.

 Just like that time, I held Efa's hand and guided it towards my lower body.
 However, this time, I didn't make her touch me- instead I changed the course, and placed her fingers upon my other wrist instead.

 v22ef0948
 エファ「Ah, um... actually, it's not the first time...」
 v21cr1292
 クリス「Eh?
 If I remember correctly, you told me earlier that you'd never touched it before...」
 v22ef0949
 エファ「P-please forgive me!」
 Her apology was so sudden I froze in surprise.
 ...However, if it's Efa saying such a thing,
  I'm sure she must have some sort of reason for it.
 v21cr1293
 クリス「I'll forgive you if you're honest with me.」
 v22ef0950
 エファ「Y-yes. Actually... a-after... that time...」
 v22ef0951
 エファ「―I couldn't help but want to check and see if I was really the same as you, Your Highness, so...」
 Embarrassment mixed with her voice as it gradually grew quieter.
 v22ef0952
 エファ「―I just meant to touch it a little bit...」
 v21cr1294
 クリス「...What do you mean by ‘just meant’?」
 v22ef0953
 エファ「...A little bit more, then a little bit more...」
 v21cr1295
 クリス「Then in the end, you kept on touching?」
 v22ef0954
 エファ「...Y-yes. I-I won't ever touch it by myself again. So please, forgive me.」
 
 Hearing how innocent she was, and those words of ‘by herself’ that she'd spoken, I felt as if I could forgive her anything.
 
 Still, if I don't do anything, there's a risk that she might make that mistake again.
 v21cr1296
 クリス「...Very well. Then, tell me one thing. When did you touch yourself?」
 
 Ever since the day of the rehearsal, she had spent most of her time with me, so I believed she hadn't had any free time to do something like that.
 
 I found it strange, thus I asked her, however―
 v22ef0955
 エファ「...T-that was... e-every night... after you fell asleep, Your Highness...」
 
 v21cr1297
 クリス「...Beside me? So you did it in secret all by yourself?」
 
 v22ef0956

 I couldn't help but laugh at her surprising confession.
 v22ef0957
 エファ「Y-Your Highness... please don't hate me for this.」
 v21cr1298
 クリス「Not at all. I like you even more than I used to.」
 I kissed Efa's cheek as her mouth trembled in anxiety, and then stole her lips with mine.

 I showed Efa the same part where she comforted herself every night for her to see.

 v21cr1302
 クリス「...Eh?」
 Shocked, I raised my hips and looked towards my thighs.
 ...And it was as Efa had said.
 Unconsciously, my burning passion for her had overflowed.
 v21cr1303
 クリス「T-this is... I... some of it must be yours...」
 v22ef0961
 エファ「Of course not. I'm not as...」

 クリス「My, what do you mean by ‘I'm not!’ Are you saying that I'm shameless?」
 
 v22ef0962
 エファ「O-of course not. I just wanted to say that I wasn't as wet as you are, Your Highness...」
 
 Apparently my nervousness had lead to a hasty assumption.
 v21cr1305
 クリス「I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, Efa.」
 I touched my forehead to hers and pleaded for forgiveness.
 v22ef0963
 エファ「...I-I won't forgive you...」
 v21cr1306
 クリス「Eh?」
 v22ef0964
 エファ「It's just, as I, said. I won't, forgive you, Your Highness...」
 ...Ahh!
 And I was wondering what was she was going to say with that tear-streaked face of hers.
 Without noticing herself, she had placed me in a spot, leaving me at a loss what I could do to brighten her face back up.

 クリス「What shall I do so you will forgive me?」

 I reversed our position by pulling Efa on top of me.

 エファ「...I am Your Highness?」
 v21cr1312

 Though this is just an act, my feelings are serious.
 I had truly wished to become Efa.

 v22ef0970
 エファ「...Um, are you sure this is all right?」
 v21cr1313

 Pretending to be Efa, I called her what she would have called me.
 And then, as if she had finally understood,
 v22ef0971
 エファ「...A-are you sure? E-fa...」
 Efa called me by her own name.
 At that moment, my heartbeat surged, and I felt a feeling of tranquility.

 Your Highness, are you all right?」

 Little by little, Efa stripped away the feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction from me.
 Once our skin parted from each other, the loneliness of losing the other's body heat made us press close again, not letting either of us escape.
  Within that repeating cycle, Efa belonged to no one other than me.

 The feelings that I couldn't say in words flowed into her as my breath.
 If I were to be with Efa― the end result shall be her falling into the pits of hell.
 ―There is no longer a future waiting for me that shines brightly.
 Not the Red and the Blue, nor the White Kingdom, will give me freedom.
 For my surname, ‘Dorn,’ carries the meaning of ‘thorn.’
 
 
 A family that bears the fate of serving this kingdom, until the very last drop of their blood departs this earth.
 If God would allow me, I wish that I could give all of this blood to Efa...
 I just want to forget everything.
 If I could have but one wish, I want to be with Efa―

 If he hadn't said that, I never would have guessed that was what he was apologizing for.
  ...Though it's not like I've forgotten about it already.
 Cero saw me naked, and I even had to drag him into the bathtub with me... of course I wouldn't be able to forget about that even if I wanted to!
 
 But talking about that won't change the past. What's important is the future.
 
 v03wa1195

 It isn't very considerate of him, but I can take advantage of this.

 As I looked at Cero with eyes full of anticipation, he nodded in acceptance.
 Since he's already agreed, I won't need to hold back.
 I scanned our surroundings, and pointed to a large tree beside the castle wall.

 My plan was simple.

 I'd found the spot closest to the top of the castle wall during the afternoon: a nearby tree one could use to climb up.
 
 In addition, the tree was very close to the wall.
 So, what do I do? ...I'm sure there was no need to question further.
 v03wa1200
 ワカバ「...Hold on a bit longer, okay. I'll definitely not forget what you've done.」

 If I had any intention of doing as he said, I wouldn't have come up in the first place.
 
 First of all, this wall is just the boundary of the castle grounds, not inside it.

 ...In that case.

 After saying that, I tried snapping the shutter a few times. The flash didn't seem to be too noticeable.

 Alright!
 Now I can take all the pictures I want.
 v04ce1226
 セロ「...Wakaba...」
 Cero's words of unease can be heard from below, but now isn't the time to worry about him.
 
 Originally, I had wanted to slip inside and look around.
 But there's probably a security alarm inside, so I had better not be that rash.
 v03wa1206
 ワカバ「Alright, now I'll just have to circle around the castle on this wall...」
 v04ce1227

 As I was about to begin walking, Cero called my name once more.
 
 st03_c05
 v03wa1207
 ワカバ「Why not? Since we're here already, I might as well take a few more pictures.」
 
 v04ce1228

 As soon as he declared that, he nimbly got down from the tree.
 As I was hesitating about whether to call him back, he disappeared from sight.
 
 st03_c03
 v03wa1208
 ワカバ「......Is, isn't that a bit too cruel?」
 If he leaves me here alone, how am I going to get down from here?
  It seems like I have to do the opposite of how I got up here, and jump back to the tree.
 ...But it's really high, and really dark. If no one is here to help me, I probably can't do it.
 
 st03_c04

 After waiting for ten seconds, I heard no reply.

 But the result was the same.
 st03_c05
 Since it's turned out like this, I have no choice but to seriously think about what I should do.
 
 Somehow, I have to find a way to get down from here!
 st03_c06
 Jumping to the tree is too dangerous. ...Then, what should I do?
 First, I thought about circling the castle wall until I reached the gate. There should be stairs to get down leading into the insides of the castle.
 
 st03_c03
 But I'll still be trapped inside the castle without any way out.
  ...If I'm not careful, I might even trigger the security alarm or alert the guards.

 How am I going to escape from here?

 Even if I whine like this, Cero won't come back.
 That's because he'd already gotten fed up with me―

 v03wa1215

 Cero silently pointed underneath the tree and then shifted his finger to me.

 Cero's tone of voice got suddenly weaker.

 セロ「―Then it would seem like I saved you just because I wanted you to kiss me.」
 He answered, his head bowed.
 v03wa1220
 ワカバ「...S―sorry. I guess something like that would trouble you, too...」
 If I was in his shoes, I would probably think the same way.
 Furthermore, I'm the one who brought this upon myself.
 Cero was even willing to come back for me, so I have no right to complain to him.
 st04_a00
 v04ce1236
 セロ「...Hurry, before anyone comes. I'll support you from below, so give me your hand.」
 He held onto my outstretched hand, and I moved back to the tree without losing my balance.

 トニ―「...Man, I can't really get used to the White Capital.」
 It's not like I'm still dwelling on the time we spent in Aubergine before we made our getaway. I just don't like tourist spots.
 
 Judging from the the number and variety of people... this would be a good place for us to do business.
 
 ...But, on the other hand, if we made any crooked deals here, our faces might become known throughout the whole country.
 
 Given the possibility of that happening, I'd much rather forego profit and continue wandering around freely.
 
 As long as I can return to my hometown once in a while to reminisce about the past, I'll be satisfied.

 ‘Que sera, sera’... even if there's some trouble along the way, I can just evade it.

 I'll meet up with Silvia later―

 v07to0106

 Why would someone call my name in a place like this?
 The voice was familiar, but it definitely wasn't Silvia's.
 I'm not really acquainted with that many men, either... so who is this?
 v04ce1240
 セロ「Mr. Tonino! I've been searching for you!」
 
 ...He said he's been searching for me.
 My feet came to a halt, and I just barely resisted the urge to look behind me. My brain, which normally I hardly ever used, started to run at full speed.
 v07to0107
 トニ―「(―Who might it be?)」
 He sounds young, so it's unlikely he's one of my old friends.
 ...Which means, he must know me through work.
 But I haven't taken on any jobs since I came to the White Capital.
  ...So the most likely possibility would be... someone that I conned in the past?
 v04ce1241

 As the owner of the voice drew closer, I realized that I was right.

 Just as I was thinking of getting away by vanishing into the crowd, why did YOU have to appear?
 
 Furthermore, there was a girl who'd been walking with him, and together they both blocked my way!
 
 v07to0109
 トニ―「Yo, Yo! How are you? You been alright since the tomato incident?」
 
 
 At that moment, I almost unthinkingly said ‘The girl you brought with you today's got longer hair than the other one did!’, but past experience has taught me it's better not to say anything pointless like that.
 
 My strategy is to bid a friendly farewell after chatting for no more than a minute!
 st04_a08
 v04ce1243
 セロ「Ah, yeah. About that time... Thanks a lot for your help.」
 His reply was much more amicable than I'd expected, and I was unable to immediately come up with a response.
 Could it be that what happened later wasn't as serious as Silvia said?
 
 ...If that's the case, it seems like it'll be easier for me to get out of this than I'd thought.

 Normally, you'd keep on running and turning in different junctions, aiming to get as far as you can from the target.
 
 But this time, I had hidden in a spot nearby, and waited for a while before emerging.
 This way, after my pursuers had passed me by, I could just nonchalantly walk away in the opposite direction.

 There's no way a person running away would stop just because they were told to.
 I dashed ahead at full speed, and zigzagged through an alley.
 Nevertheless, Coco was still hot on my trail, and I couldn't shake her off!

 I turned the next corner, and just when I was about to sprint into a shop to hide―
 
 I saw a figure beside me, and quickly ground to a halt.

 I had been waiting for Coco in the lobby, and just as I was about to go back to my room, Angelina had appeared.
 
 Since we're staying in the same room, we'd inevitably meet if I went back.
 But to meet by chance like this... I can't help but feel grateful for that bit of serendipity.

 A lot had happened.
 In Aubergine, back when I was still sick, Coco had gone berserk.
  We had searched high and low for the doll engineer who'd given Coco that Drop, and it'd turned into a mess.

 I wasn't clear about what had happened in Aubergine, so I can't really have an opinion on that, but that incident with the gun in the car park―
 
 st00_a08
 v00an0722
 アンジ「Coco, who had been the real victim, said it was alright, and Cero, who had been the one to get conned, said he forgave them as well, so I guess that's that.」
 
 v01be0553
 ベル「...I guess so.」
 I'd heard they were wanted, so I figured they were really bad people.
 But after Cero phoned Aubergine's City Hall for confirmation, it turned out that it wasn't a criminal bounty, just a reward offered for finding them.
 
 
 In the past, some wealthy businessman had met Silvia, and was now offering a reward if anyone reported seeing her as he wanted to meet her again through whatever means.

 Together, Coco and I apologized to the people in the hotel, and then returned to our respective rooms.
 
 ―I've been chasing after people from dawn to dusk. I... can't take it anymore.

 At the sight of a girl in a white dress jogging up the stairs to the stage, I called out a name reflexively.

 ベル「Miss Angelina?」
 But the figure whose back my eyes had chased was smaller than hers, so it might have been someone else.
 
 v03wa1441
 ワカバ「...Crap!」
 And wasn't that Wakaba's voice just now?
 v01be0616
 ベル「(―Was that really... Miss Angelina?)」
 I tilted my head, thinking I should just let it be and start practicing.
  But I was still worried about that figure wearing the dress, so I went to ask Light, who was idling around nearby, about it.
 
 v01be0618
 ベル「...Light, did you see Miss Angelina just now?」
 st05_a06
 v05li0726
 ライト「Nah, I haven't. But now that you mentioned it, Sis isn't around either.」
 Light said as he turned his head, glancing this way and that.
 ...Suddenly, we heard a cheeky laugh from the stage.

 ワカバ「Tadada―!
 Your princess is here!」

 As she came down the stairs, wearing a dress of the sort she usually never would, we were at a loss for how to react.

 Wearing Princess Christina's dress, Wakaba gave us a gleeful smile, and slowly walked towards us.

 Did he say that so it wouldn't lead to trouble later on?
 Or is it that he's embarrassed to say what he thinks because everyone is around?
 v01be0620
 ベル「(―No, I mustn't think badly of others.)」
 Even though I felt sorry for Wakaba... there was but one answer to her question.

 I fell silent, and glanced at the others nearby.

 Didn't I say just now? Mom gave it to me on my last birthday.」
 
 v01be0985
 ベル「...Your mother.」
 v03wa2049
 ワカバ「Well, then my mom got it from her mom... so it was from my grandma. My family's poor, but we still have a heirloom like this, I guess?」
 
 v01be0986
 ベル「...A heirloom...」
 v03wa2050
 ワカバ「Well, this is our heirloom that's been passed down for generations. ...Though I think it was originally owned by a noblewoman in some kingdom.」
 
 v03wa2051
 ワカバ「―And after she passed away, her belongings were distributed among her relatives as inheritence.」
 
 v03wa2052
 ワカバ「So she was like our ancestor!」
 v01be0987
 ベル「......And then this necklace was passed down... from generation to generation?」
 v03wa2053
 ワカバ「―I guess so? But you know, there are some conditions for this to be passed down to one's children.」
 
 v03wa2054
 ワカバ「One of them is, if at all possible, this must be given to a girl. ...Well, of course, since this isn't something a boy would wear.」
 
 v03wa2055
 ワカバ「And then, this must be put on at the moment it is given to her.」
 v01be0988
 ベル「...?」
 v03wa2056
 ワカバ「And then, she must express her thoughts at that moment.」
 v01be0989

 v03wa2057
 ワカバ「Hmm, what did I say back then? I think... it was something like ‘thank you,’ I guess?」
 
 v03wa2058
 ワカバ「Oh, but when I got that necklace, I had this thought.」

 v01be0991
 ベル「...Wakaba.」
 sv037c
 v03wa2063
 ワカバ「Ehehe! I wore Anne's dress of my own accord, but I understand that it doesn't suit me, just the same.」
 
 v03wa2064
 ワカバ「―Still, I'm sure that there must be someone among my ancestors that this necklace fit perfectly.」
 
 v01be0992
 ベル「(―Your Highness...)」
 The other me inside of me had known the owner of that pendant all too well.
 At that time long, long ago, when I was still Efa...
 In a flash, another person's memories had entered my mind... the memory of a princess. 
 Long, long ago... I had...
 v01be0993
 ベル「(―The Memory of Dorn...)」
 These two memories that were not mine sunk back to the abyss in my Memory Stone, leaving only a ripple.
 
 v01be0994
 ベル「...Thank you, Wakaba.」
 sv037b
 v03wa2065
 ワカバ「Hm? Have you seen enough?」
 v01be0995
 ベル「Yes, I feel a little better.」
 For me to be here... was definitely because of Her Highness's guidance, and I firmly believed that my meeting with Wakaba was no mere miracle, but destiny.
 
 v01be0996
 ベル「That pendant really suits you a lot!」
 sv037c
 v03wa2066
 ワカバ「Oh, thank you!
 Even if it's flattery, I'm still happy.」
 v01be0997

 Wakaba was different from the princess I had known.
 Still, there's a little of Her Highness in the color of her eyes.

 ワカバ「S-stop praising me so much, I'm not good with things like that, you know. Ahahaha.」

 Do you want to hold it after all?」

 She probably won't understand, but this was a sincere feeling from both of us.

 I smiled as Belle passed by me, rubbing her eyes in fatigue.
 
 Even though her friends' late-night march down the corridor had been inappropriate, I was glad to know that she had friends like them.
 
 She's been alive for a long time... if she'd spent all those years by herself, she would've felt lonely, even though she's a Schwester.

 After we exited the hotel, I took out the small map Wakaba had given me, and explained our plans as I showed it to Belle.

 v00an0759
 アンジ「That's where the Cardinal Library, the oldest and largest library in the country, is located. It seems Cero wants to go there to research something.」
 
 According to Cero, the research was intended to help Wakaba finish her play.
  Even though it's fictional, we should still do some background research for it.
 I completely agreed with him on that.
  The more we know about what really happened back then, the easier time we'll have with the performance.
 v00an0760

 v00an0762
 アンジ「Who knows? Cero is the one who suggested it. He said he'd explain when we got there.」
 
 He'd only told me the name of the place to get off at, so I was a little uneasy too.
 But Cero had said that he'd be waiting at the bus stop beforehand, so I guess it'll work out.

 Belle and I got off the stop Cero had specified, where we met up with him.
 Cero must have wanted us to be able to find him easily, and was standing near the front of the bus stop.
 
 v00an0764
 アンジ「Even though we took the earliest bus, we just barely made it in time.」
 We were afraid of being late, so we left the hotel early, but things hadn't really gone as expected.
 
 st04_a04
 v04ce1260
 セロ「...Ahaha. There were a lot of tourists getting on and off the bus, right?」
 As he had said, there had been a ton of stops on the way. Huge crowds poured on and off at every stop, while all I could do was keep checking the time on my watch.
 
 v00an0765
 アンジ「So, Mister Guide, what did you want us to see?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1261
 セロ「...Right, come this way.」
 Cero nodded firmly in response to my question, and started walking.
 He slowly lead us away from the rest of the tourists.
 
 When we could hardly hear their nearby, he calmly began his explanation.
 
 st04_a06
 v04ce1262

 st04_a02
 v04ce1263
 セロ「Of course, it still serves that purpose, but as you can see, it hasn't been resurfaced.」
 
 The spacious, peaceful natural scenery was quite a change of pace for a city dweller like me.
 
 It felt different, walking through the countryside instead of watching it pass by from the train. Comparing the two, I decided that experiencing nature firsthand was much more comfortable.
 
 v00an0766
 アンジ「But since this is a tourist spot, shouldn't they patch it up a bit more? The road isn't paved at all, so the bus was shaking pretty badly on the way here.」
 
 
 In response to my grumbling, Cero laughed a little.
 st04_a04
 v04ce1264
 セロ「...They've left the road alone for various reasons, such as preserving the scenery here.」
 
  After saying that, he stopped walking.
 He then straightened up, and pointed to a small hill to his right.
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1265
 セロ「That's why all the heavily traveled roads and train tracks were built across the hill over there.」
 
 It seems like Cero had already researched this area beforehand.
 The proof of that was held in his hands; a tourist map that he'd written on in a couple of places.
 
 v00an0767
 アンジ「So that means, the area around here... has been preserved to look just as it did in the past?」
 st04_a01
 v04ce1266
 セロ「Well, I can't say that it's exactly the same as it was in the play's era, but naturally the landscape outside the city has always been the same.」
 
 face01_a05
 v01be0592
 ベル「Somehow, I feel like I've seen this scenery before.」
 As we listened to Cero's explanation, Belle, who'd kept quiet until now, spoke up.
 Her gaze was fixed on a faraway place―
 I suddenly had a flight of fancy: Belle's legs lifting off the ground and her soaring off into the sky, just like that.
 
 st04_a08
 v04ce1267
 セロ「Even though this place isn't as hilly as Silberg, it's still filled with nature... so they might be similar.」
 
 face01_a01
 v01be0593

 She smiled brightly as she said that.
 It seems like even though she only recently left her hometown, she misses it.
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1268
 セロ「Also, it wasn't just the scenery that I wanted you guys to see.」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1269
 セロ「―Down this road, there is... a grave.」
 The next place Cero pointed was down the road.
 The area he pointed to was a ways away from the tourists, who'd gone on ahead of us.
 But I didn't see anything resembling a gravestone over there.
 v00an0768
 アンジ「...Are you sure there's a grave there?」
 st04_a02

 In the middle of the road we were walking on, there was a stone plate.
 There were some words inscribed on it, but erosion had rendered them illegible.

 セロ「According to the guidebook, it was so that people could ‘Tread upon the sins of the traitor, preserve the memory over the ages, and hand down the punishment forever’...」
 
 Cero read from the papers in his hand with a frown.
 I crouched down, and brushed the dirt off the stone plate.
 v00an0770

 face01_a03
 v01be0595

 v04ce1273
 セロ「According to the guide, it was immediately after Ein's death.」

 v01be0596

 A sad expression floated upon Belle's face, but the emotion there was slightly different from pity.
 
 v04ce1274
 セロ「...I'm sorry. It wasn't my intent to make you guys uncomfortable.」
 
 st04_a02
 v04ce1275

 st04_a07
 v04ce1276
 セロ「―And how he is being treated by them.」
 At a loss for words, I could only gaze silently at Ein's resting spot.
 One thing I understood was that Ein, who had been branded as a traitor, was eternally suffering within this grave, forever being stepped on by the people passing by.
 
 Another was that the weight of the punishment he'd have to endure was dependent both on the history of the past, as it had been written until now, and the history of the future that has yet to be written.
 
 v00an0771
 アンジ「(―Ein, did you really betray Princess Christina and the White Kingdom?)」

 v00an0773
 アンジ「...That's a pretty vague question, but I'm sure you're not looking for an answer like ‘How sad a fate,’ right?」
 
 Belle nodded silently. And so I told her my current thoughts, which were the same as they'd been in the past.
 v00an0774
 アンジ「...I don't think Ein was a bad person.」
 That's why I was attracted to Wakaba's reckless creation, this fictional story where Ein isn't a traitor.
 
 st01_a04
 v01be0599
 ベル「Even though I can't really explain it... I feel that way too.」
 Hearing Belle's words of agreement strengthened my resolve.
 ...I believe that Ein was a righteous person, the way that he'll be on our stage.
 That way, no matter how much criticism arises― They can never twist the truth that exists on stage.
 
 v00an0775

 After we'd told them the problem and the room number, the hotel immediately instructed someone to go check.
 
 We waited about ten minutes, and then the hotel worker handed me a brown envelope, the same as the one Sis had described.

 ワカバ「Ahhhhh!」
  suddenly, Wakaba came flying back out.

 face03_a06

 ワカバ「...Ugh.」
  Wakaba couldn't think of a retort.
  How did Silvia know about our problem?
 Her explanation for that was simple.
 She'd spotted some familiar faces, namely Cero and Light, and greeted them. They had told her about the problem regarding Wakaba's draft... but at the hotel,
 
 st06_a07
 v06si0330
 シルヴ「...There was only a brown envelope with nothing inside.」
 st06_a08

 Even though we don't really want to suspect her, we couldn't say it was impossible either.

 Only four of us― Angelina, Wakaba, Cero and I― had managed to reach the mining village, Chrome.
 
 As for why we're two people short, that's because Wakaba jumped to conclusions.

 Wakaba nodded when I asked her that.
 Listening in on our conversation, Angelina said,
 v00an0799
 アンジ「...Ah, so it's the two that had those bounty- er, search posters up for them.」
  It seemed she remembered both of them.
 
 But why are Silvia and Tonino bringing Coco and Light?
 Having spoken to Light on the phone, Wakaba was able to explain why they made such an offer.
 
 The two of them said that they were grateful we'd forgiven them, so in return, they're going to drive Coco and Light over here.
 
 
 But the details hadn't been settled yet, so we needed to wait for them to phone again.
 
 face03_a01

 ワカバ「More importantly, did anything happen between you and Anne?」
  She said, looking at me with a serious expression.

 I hoped a vague answer would satisfy her, but of course she wouldn't let me off that easily.
 
 She didn't stop gazing at me, either.

 I told Wakaba how she'd given me a few acting tips, but seemed disinterested, leaving me at an impasse.

 I'd heard about the issue with Coco and Light an hour ago, so I wasn't in a good mood and replied unreservedly in annoyance.

 アンジ「(―Could it be?!)」
 That on the train ride to Chrome, she'd heard me and Belle arguing―,
  no, this wasn't the right word to use, but I couldn't quite find the right one to describe what had happened between us.
 ...The reason was simple.
 Belle had used a Drop when she sang at the White Capital, which had worried me, and I'd questioned her about it.
 
 
 
 But Belle didn't seem to know why I was asking her, so I got fed up―
 
 v00an0817
 アンジ「(―And things got a little awkward...)」
 Silvia, who hardly could have known about all this, had seen right through me.
 As I thought that, I felt that I was hopeless at understanding others in comparison.
 v00an0818
 アンジ「...But, aren't Drops expensive?」
 
 
 I glanced at the gem I was holding, and closer inspectation made me realize that I couldn't afford it even if my purse were ten times as full.

 シルヴ「You can forget about the price. Take a look, there's quite a selection.」
 She smiled, and pointed to a gem in the opposite direction.
 v06si0352

 v06si0353
 シルヴ「See, there are times... like when you look at a present, and remember the precious feelings that person evoked in you, aren't there?」
 
 Silvia was right.
 For Belle, maybe that Drop she used was just like a charm, a prized possession that helped her summon her courage.
 
 
 
 Of course, even if the fact was that it had an effect like a drug, I still didn't have the right to tell her not to use it.
 
 Instead, I should have been happy for her, since she was able to sing perfectly.
 
 v00an0819
 アンジ「(―I should have been more open-minded...)」
 My own wishes were not necessarily what was best for her.
 If I didn't even try to understand her viewpoint, ignorance like that could sour the best of relationships. 
 
 v00an0820
 アンジ「...Hey, Silvia.」
 I need to thank her for helping me realize...
 But I couldn't think of how to put it.
 And then,
 ev017b
 v00an0821
 アンジ「Do you have something that holds your precious feelings too?」
  I asked, half jokingly.
 
 black450
 v06si0354
 シルヴ「...W-well. I do have something like that.」
 v00an0822
 アンジ「(―Ah, that was unexpected...)」
 Silvia, dauntless as she is, is getting embarrassed?
 ev017j
 v06si0355
 シルヴ「But I've been too embarrassed to let that person know my feelings.」
 v00an0823
 アンジ「Hmm, I see.」
 v06si0356
 シルヴ「...Ugh, forget about my problems!
 Right now let's focus on your shopping!」
 
 I'd finally noticed there was more to her than her egotism.
 ev017c
 v00an0824
 アンジ「So, which Drop is best?」
 
 
 v06si0357
 シルヴ「...Decide that yourself.」
 As if taking revenge for what happened earlier, she wouldn't give me her opinion.
 I checked the amount inside my purse, and finally decided on a gem.
 
 ev017b
 v00an0825
 アンジ「...This, I guess?」
 v06si0358
 シルヴ「You've decided?
 Well, then I'll take over!」
 After saying that, she stopped me from trying to get the money from my purse.
 ev017d
 And then,
 v06si0359
 シルヴ「Hey, mister―」
  She waved to the worker behind the counter, acting as if she'd changed into a completely different person.
 Speaking in a sultry voice completely different from her usual one, she started toying with the gem in her hands.
 v06si0360
 シルヴ「...Ehehe. Could you give me the usual discount, please?」
 black450
 v00an0826
 アンジ「(―That's pretty slick...)」
 Looking at her, I couldn't help but wonder if Tonino―
 ―might have had quite some trying experiences with her while we weren't around to see.

 ワカバ「...The sky looks ominous. Seems like it's going to rain.」
 As I'd heard, the weather changes often in the mountains. 
 If I had thought this would happen, I would have brought an umbrella with me when I headed out for a stroll.
 st04_a00
 v04ce1459
 セロ「Do you want to hurry back to the inn?」
 Cero, beside me, seemed to be picking up his pace as well. 
 I'd wanted to chat and take it easy while walking back, but at this moment, his suggestion was prudent.
 
 st03_c06
 v03wa1461
 ワカバ「...Then let's do that.」
 To catch up with his brisk pace, I tried to take longer steps.
  ...But, is it the difference in our height? I even started to run―
 After noticing this, Cero naturally slowed down.
 st03_c03
 v03wa1462
 ワカバ「(―Ah.)」
 ...Half of me felt happy, the other lonesome.
  I was happy because Cero was so considerate of me.
 But, though I was once satisfied with that alone, I haven't been able to feel genuinely happy since I came to a realization lately.
 
 st03_c07
 v03wa1463
 ワカバ「(―Somehow, I feel like... I'm always causing trouble.)」
 I didn't know when it had started, but this trip had proven it.
 First Light unexpectedly joining us, then the tickets to Aubergine, and now forgetting the original draft in the White Capital...
 
 All of them had been entirely my fault, but Cero had never scolded me for them.
 st03_c03
 v03wa1464
 ワカバ「(―It's okay if you grumble a little.)」
 Even though it would upset me at first, I'd be happy afterwards.
  ...No, wait, what would happen actually? 
 If I were to be scolded in front of everyone, it would leave quite a scar. But if it were just between the two of us―
 
 
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce1460
 セロ「Hey, Wakaba. You stopped talking and started looking glum all of a sudden... Are you okay?」
 
 v03wa1465
 ワカバ「Ah, yeah. I'm sorry.」
 My bad habit that when I start thinking about things, I forget about my surroundings.
 st04_a00
 v04ce1461
 セロ「If there's something troubling you, talk to me about it.」
 v03wa1466
 ワカバ「―Well, you're right on that it's something troubling...」
 But I can't say ‘scold me’ or something like that in front of him, can I?
 st04_a04
 v04ce1462
 セロ「Is it about Ange?」
 v03wa1467
 ワカバ「Huh!?」
 Since I hadn't been expecting that name, I said something strange in reply.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1463
 セロ「H-huh?
 Was I mistaken?」
 v03wa1468
 ワカバ「...Yeah, you were. But why did you mention Anne's name?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1464
 セロ「Eh, that's because you were arguing near the inn...」
 v03wa1469
 ワカバ「(―Arguing?
 Does he mean...)」
 Where I was trying to help Belle out, and Angelina started talking about my relationship with Cero instead.
  ...Wait, how!?
 v03wa1470
 ワカバ「...How did you know about that, Cero?」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1465
 セロ「Well, I just happened to overhear it...」
 v03wa1471
 ワカバ「You were nearby!?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1466
 セロ「...Not exactly nearby, I was inside my room in the inn. I couldn't really hear what you were saying, but I could tell it was you two.」
 
 v03wa1472
 ワカバ「......」
 Angelina had stayed calm, while I'd been shouting by the end of it.
 st04_a03
 v04ce1467
 セロ「Since it sounded like an argument, I wondered if you two were alright. When I got worried enough to go outside, you were gone already.」
 
 After hearing that, the pressure on me seemed to relax.
  If he'd really heard, I don't know what I would have done.
 v03wa1473
 ワカバ「Then, you really don't know what Anne and I talked about, right?」
 I asked him once more, gazing intently into his eyes.
 st04_a06
 v04ce1468
 セロ「...No.」
 It doesn't seem like he's lying.
  But when he looks back at me like that, it's making my heart pound...
 v03wa1474
 ワカバ「...It, it wasn't really important, you know.」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1469
 セロ「Really?
 Then I guess it's fine.」
 Cero seemed to believe what I said, and left it at that.
 
 ...But that's wrong. I wanted him to pursue it further.
 v03wa1475
 ワカバ「B-but... even if I say that, you're still worried, right?」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1470
 セロ「Well, since you ask if I'm worried, then I am...」
 Even though I knew that doing this is completely on my own accord, but I still asked him.
 v03wa1476
 ワカバ「...You know, in the White Capital, Belle―」
 black450
 First, following the order of events, I told him about Belle joining the choir in singing at the White Capital.
 
 And then, I told him how Angelina had been suspicious of Belle and questioned her on the train heading to Chrome.
 
 bg15a11
 st04_a03
 v03wa1477
 ワカバ「―After that, I went to Angelina and asked ‘why?’... But in the end, the conversation turned ugly somehow.」
 
 Cero listened in silence until I finished talking, and finally―
 st04_a06
 v04ce1471
 セロ「So that's how it is...」
  he replied.
 v03wa1478
 ワカバ「...Somehow, that's a cold reaction.」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1472
 セロ「W-was it?」
 v03wa1479
 ワカバ「Never mind. Anyway, tell me what you really think.」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1473
 セロ「Then let me ask first... what do you want to do about it, Wakaba?」
 v03wa1480
 ワカバ「What do I want to do... of course, I want to make up with Anne.」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1474
 セロ「Hm, I see. So it'll be alright if you're able to make up with her?」
 That's right, that's right... wait, didn't you just repeat what I said?
 v03wa1481
 ワカバ「I'm trying to think of a way to do it.」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1475
 セロ「...How about just apologizing to her directly?」
 v03wa1482
 ワカバ「Why?
 Am I only the one in the wrong?
 Wasn't any of it Anne's fault?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1476
 セロ「I wasn't there, so I can't judge who was right or wrong.」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1477
 セロ「―I feel that you don't need to ask my opinion, and could find the truth within yourself.」
 
 v03wa1483
 ワカバ「...Myself?」
 v04ce1478
 セロ「Yup. Just now, before leaving the inn, you called Belle and I over and explained to us the next leg of the trip, right?」
 
 We'll meet up in Vermilion, the final stop before we return to Moosgrun- that was what me and Light decided.
 
 When I was sharing this with them―
 st04_a02
 v04ce1479
 セロ「At that time, why didn't you call Ange over?」
 v03wa1484
 ワカバ「That's because we just had an argument, so it seemed awkward to bother her again.」
 I thought that he would understand the reason I did that without explaining further, so I left it at that.
 
 v03wa1485
 ワカバ「It's not like I'm purposely leaving Anne out, you know? ...I asked Belle to let her know about our plans.」
 
 
 st04_a08
 v04ce1480
 セロ「...But doesn't doing that mean that you felt guilty somehow?」
 v03wa1486
 ワカバ「R-really?」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1481
 セロ「Even after you calmed down from the argument with her, you didn't want to see her...」
 
 st04_a04
 v04ce1482
 セロ「―Doesn't that mean you have a feeling of ‘was it my fault?’ more or less?」
 
 v03wa1487
 ワカバ「...I guess.」
 That's totally correct. His accusation was like an arrow shot through my chest.
 I'd shown my weakness to Angelina. That's why I didn't want to see her or call her over.
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce1483
 セロ「If you can talk to her, you can make up with her. I'm sure that's something you understand without me explaining further.」
 
 v03wa1488
 ワカバ「...That's why you told me to search for the answer within myself, right?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1484
 セロ「Yup.」
 ...I've lost to Cero.
 An impulsive sort like me could only envy his calmness.
 v03wa1489
 ワカバ「I'm always messing up and relying on others, aren't I.」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1485
 セロ「Of course not.」
 v03wa1490
 ワカバ「...That's what you always say.」
 Can't he use his brain instead of parroting the same soothing words at me?
 Even though I want to be a novelist in the future, I can't even think of what to say now.
 
 v03wa1491
 ワカバ「(―I'm such a failure...)」
 But, just when I thought I'd let it all out in a sigh,
 I realized there was someone I had to apologize to before Angelina.
 
 v03wa1492
 ワカバ「...Hey, Cero.」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1486
 セロ「Hm?」
 v03wa1493
 ワカバ「I'm sorry for everything.」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1487
 セロ「No, there's nothing that you need to apologize to me for.」
 v03wa1494
 ワカバ「...It's okay, don't worry about it. It's for my own peace of mind.」
 And then, I can't just apologize!
 v03wa1495
 ワカバ「―Thank you so much for everything, too.」
 Apologizing is important, but I also have to properly express my gratitude once in a while.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1488
 セロ「Er, I haven't really...」
 v03wa1496
 ワカバ「It's okay,
 
  you should just be honest and accept it.」
 I took a deep breath, and looked towards the sky.
 bg15a10
 st04_a05
 v03wa1497
 ワカバ「Ah, it's raining!
 Let's get back quickly!」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1489
 セロ「Y-yeah.」
 As the falling rain poured upon us, we started running.
 Never put off till tomorrow what can be done today!
 I have to strike while the iron is hot!
 Just having this resolution wasn't enough- even so, it's my main weapon.
  I'll cling to these feelings and go apologize to Angelina.
 black450
 ...And to Belle as well.

 アンジ「I'm sorry. Calling you out in the rain like this.」
 v01be0623
 ベル「It's fine. It's just drizzling, so I think it'll stop soon.」
 I'm beneath of the eaves at the inn in Chrome, looking at the gray sky.
  The weather changing easily in the highlands - Silberg has the same trait.
 Even though the children hate rain because they couldn't go out and play, it's an important gift from nature.
 
 Perhaps, because it's always been sunny recently, I felt refreshed by the change. 
 st00_a00
 v00an0834
 アンジ「Why the smile?
 Did you remember something nice?」
 v01be0624
 ベル「No. It's just that I was thinking, it's been a long time since it rained...」
 st00_a06
 v00an0835
 アンジ「Yeah. Do you like the rain?」
 I was startled by her sudden question, and wasn't sure what to answer.
 Do I like the rain? Or do I not?
  If it rained every day, it would make me feel gloomy.
 On the other hand, if it were sunny every day, I would surely miss rainy days.
 st00_a01

 v01be0625

 st00_a04
 v00an0837
 アンジ「No, of course not. Even though it's my own question, somehow I feel it's hard to answer it myself.」
 
 After saying that, as she waved her hand in front of her,
 st00_a06
 v00an0838
 アンジ「Forget about that question just now,」
  she added and slowly turned to face me.
 
 st00_a00
 v00an0839
 アンジ「―By the way, it seemed like you were talking with Wakaba earlier...」
 v01be0626

 v01be0627

 st00_a05
 v00an0841

 v01be0628
 ベル「Wakaba said that we would be departing tomorrow morning.」
 st00_a00
 v00an0842
 アンジ「...I see. I think I understand now, thank you.」
 Angelina stared up at the gray sky, hardly moving.
 As she'd asked me to come here, I didn't know what to do next, so I could only idly look in the same direction as her.
 
 st00_a08
 v00an0843
 アンジ「...I'm sorry, having you join me out here without really having anything important to talk to you about.」
 
 v01be0629
 ベル「...It's fine. But why did you ask me?」
 She'd been the only one not present when we were discussing our travel plans.
 I had thought she might have already heard about them, but from our talk just now, it seems like that wasn't the case.
 
 st00_a03
 v00an0844
 アンジ「It's kind of embarrassing. I just argued with Wakaba, so I didn't want to ask her.」
 v01be0630
 ベル「Argued?
 With Wakaba?
 Why?」
 st00_a07
 v00an0845
 アンジ「How should I say it... She was talking a lot and it was getting annoying, so I said something flippant to her... and it turned out like this.」
 
 v01be0631
 ベル「...Did it have anything to do with the play?」
 st00_a02
 v00an0846
 アンジ「Wakaba seems to think that it had something to do with that. But she's completely got the wrong idea.」
 
 
 
 Angelina's eyebrows creased, and she sighed.
 (―I wonder what she said?)
 「...‘Got the wrong idea?’」
 v01be0632
 ベル「...‘Got the wrong idea?’」
 They must have disagreed with each other somehow, but I couldn't suggest a way to make up without knowing what had happened.
 
 st00_a09
 v00an0847
 アンジ「That's right. We're traveling together for the sake of the play.
  But, isn't it a pain when people pry into each others' private business?」
 v01be0633
 ベル「...Y-yeah.」
 v00an0848
 アンジ「She just says whatever's on her mind without thinking...」
 Did she got mad just from thinking about it? She kicked a small stone under her foot into the road.
 
 The stone fell into a puddle, and ripples spread elsewhere.
 st00_a08
 v00an0849
 アンジ「...Do you think it's a pointless thing to be upset over?」
 v01be0634
 ベル「...No. Everyone has their own thoughts. Since I don't know anything about what happened...」
 
 st00_a06
 v00an0850
 アンジ「What if that argument had something to do with you?」
 v01be0635
 ベル「(―I wonder what she said?)」
 I felt that prying any further would be tactless, so I fell silent.
 ...But so did she. For a while, we heard only the sound of the rain.
 
 st00_a04
 v00an0851
 アンジ「...Oh well, making you listen to my griping isn't very nice, I suppose.
  Since this is a problem between me and Wakaba.」
 v01be0636
 ベル「I don't mind at all. Talking to others about your problems can help you calm down as well.」
 
 st00_a08
 v00an0852
 アンジ「...I guess. But since it's you I'm talking to, I couldn't explain everything.」
 
 v01be0637
 ベル「Eh?」
  I was surprised by her unexpected turn of phrase.
 And just when I wanted to ask her what she meant by that―
 v03wa1459
 ワカバ「Belle?
 Anne?」
 Wakaba's voice called out from inside the inn.
 v01be0638
 ベル「Seems like she's looking for both of us.」
 st00_a07
 v00an0853
 アンジ「Yeah. But I don't feel like seeing Wakaba at the moment.」
 Somehow, hearing her say that made me feel the very same way.
 v01be0639
 ベル「...Do you want to go away from the inn for a while?」
 I opened the lip of the basket I was holding and pulled out a foldable umbrella.
 Even though it was small, if we stuck together we could still fit under it.
 st00_a00
 v00an0854
 アンジ「Thank you. Then, if you'll excuse my company.」
 She said, as she reached her hand towards mine.
 st00_a06
 v00an0855
 アンジ「I'll hold it.」
 I thought of declining for a moment, but in the end I decided to leave it to her.

 Did you get wet?」
 v01be0640
 ベル「...I'm fine. How about you, Miss Angelina?」
 v00an0857
 アンジ「I'm fine, don't worry about me. More importantly, you have to be careful your wing doesn't get wet.」
 
 We'd been walking under the umbrella together, side by side.
 I felt bad for being happy that Wakaba had upset Angelina, since it had given me the chance to take a stroll with her.
 
 sv025c
 v00an0858
 アンジ「―About that argument earlier.」
 v00an0859
 アンジ「To tell you the truth, the reason for the argument was... my behavior, and yours.」
 v01be0641
 ベル「Ours?」
 v00an0860
 アンジ「...After leaving the White Kingdom and heading to Chrome,
 
  I talked to you on the train about the time when you joined the choir team to sing, right?」 
 
 
 v01be0642
 ベル「...Y-yes.」
 v00an0861
 アンジ「I saw it. Before you started singing, you swallowed a Drop.」
 
 
 
 That alone was enough to understand why Angelina had been worried about the time I'd sung with the choir, back in the train.
 
 When I had received maintenance in Aubergine, Father had given me a Drop. 
 
 
 
 That Drop had the function of letting me disperse all idle thoughts and focusing on a single matter.
 
 v00an0862
 アンジ「I heard from your father that the reason you felt ill before arriving in Aubergine was because you'd overdosed on anxiety-reducing Drops, right?」
 
 
 
 
 v01be0643
 ベル「...Yes.」
 I understood now that Angelina had heard about the Drops from Father.
 
 
 v00an0863
 アンジ「―That's why I kept thinking things like ‘What if she falls ill again?’ or ‘She's done something dangerous’, and got really worried.」
 She took a deep breath as she concluded that.
 v01be0644
 ベル「(―So everyone knew about it...)」
 That I'd messed up by overdosing on Drops and caused everyone to worry.
 My cheeks burned in shame.
 ...But after thinking about it, that was a natural conclusion.
 Since Angelina was always with me, it would have been weird if Father hadn't told her about the reason I was feeling ill. 
 
 sv025b
 v00an0864
 アンジ「You weren't sure whether to use it or not before singing, right?」
 v01be0645
 ベル「...Yes.」
 v00an0865
 アンジ「...I'm sorry.」
 v01be0646
 ベル「Miss... Angelina?」
 I was expecting Angelina to scold me after I admitted the truth. I didn't understand why she was apologizing. 
 
 v00an0866
 アンジ「Just now, I was tempted to say something cool like ‘I was worried about you!’, but that wasn't what I was thinking at the time.」
 
 v00an0867
 アンジ「―I was thinking of what it would be like to watch you sing without relying on the Drop.」
 
 
 v01be0647
 ベル「...I'm sorry.」
  It was natural for her to say that.
 At that time, I surrendered to my temporary unease and gave up something much more important― 
 I failed to sing with everything I had and betrayed Angelina's trust in me. 
 That was something unforgivable, no matter how many times I apologize.
 But even so, Angelina―
 v00an0868
 アンジ「No, don't apologize. If you do, I'll feel bad.」
 She slowed her pace, and shook her head from side to side as she gazed downwards.
 v00an0869
 アンジ「...The fault was mine to begin with.」
 I couldn't understand her reasoning.
 v01be0648
 ベル「Why is that?」
 No matter how I thought of it, I was in the wrong, and not Angelina.
 v00an0870
 アンジ「At that time, I was the one who suggested you join the choir. It was thoughtless of me to suddenly tell you ‘Go ahead and sing.’」
 
 v00an0871
 アンジ「―I didn't consider your feelings in the slightest, and was still excited to hear your singing even after you used the Drop.」
 
 
 
 v01be0649
 ベル「...But that's...」
 v00an0872
 アンジ「―In conclusion... If I were in your shoes, I would probably have used the Drop too.」
 
 
 
 v01be0650
 ベル「...Miss Angelina.」
 v00an0873
 アンジ「I was the one who forced you to do it in the first place. For me to tell you ‘you mustn't use those Drops’... or something, how selfish of me.」
 
 
 It was obvious that she was trying to cover for me.
 v00an0874
 アンジ「...In addition, I even said that ‘I was worried about you...’ What's with me, I wonder?」
 Even as the rain grew quieter, Angelina's voice sounded as if it were about to disappear.
 v00an0875
 アンジ「―I was the one with the wrong idea.」
 I couldn't understand how could she keep disparaging herself.
 Even though I couldn't explain it, there was definitely something wrong with it.
 I wasn't good at disagreeing with people.
 But, right now―
 v01be0651
 ベル「That's not true at all. They're different matters entirely.」
 I said without thinking, and instantly regretted it,
 ...But since I've already disagreed with her, I can't take it back.
 v00an0876
 アンジ「Why?
 That's just your own conjencture...」
 v01be0652
 ベル「That might be true, but!」
 I took a deep breath, and arranged the thoughts in my mind.
 v01be0653
 ベル「(―I have to calm down...)」
 That's because, right now, I need to clearly express my feelings to her.
 v01be0654
 ベル「...I don't know the details about what you and Wakaba talked about.」
 v01be0655
 ベル「That's why, as a third party, I can't say anything about it.」
 v01be0656
 ベル「―But, regarding the the singing incident, that wasn't just your own concern... it was a problem for both of us.」
 v00an0877
 アンジ「―Earlier, when I said ‘since it's you I'm talking to, I couldn't explain everything...’ it might be because I knew that I was at fault.」
 
 v01be0657
 ベル「......」
 v00an0878
 アンジ「In the end, it was just all because of my own selfishness...」
 v01be0658
 ベル「That's not true!」
 v00an0879
 アンジ「...What about it isn't true?」
 I'd disagreed with her, but what I wanted to say was still locked inside my heart.
  How can I translate it into words?
 v01be0659
 ベル「...Miss Angelina, why do you keep saying it was all just because of you?」
 v00an0880
 アンジ「It's just like I explained. If I'd been more mature, then I wouldn't have caused so much trouble for you...」
 v01be0660
 ベル「Please wait!」
 I shouted without thinking, shocking her.
  Still, I had to say it.
 v01be0661
 ベル「...Please don't try to solve everything by yourself.」
 v01be0662
 ベル「If you just apologize and leave it at that, who knows when I might make the same mistake again in the future?」
 v01be0663
 ベル「―And that's why this is a problem for the both of us.」
 Finally, I'd made clear the reason I couldn't agree with how she kept blaming herself. 
 I hoped that she wouldn't end this matter by taking responsibility for it all.

 アンジ「...I understand.」
 Angelina turned to face me, while holding the umbrella.
  And it seems like she wasn't angry.
 st00_d00
 v00an0882
 アンジ「So, how about we recognize each others faults by saying ‘Sorry’ to each other?」
 Instead, she suggested that in a gentle tone.
 v01be0664
 ベル「......」
 As she stared at me, my mind went blank. I realized I'd nodded silently to her, and followed it up with ‘Wait!’
 
 v01be0665
 ベル「(―I can't answer her like that without even thinking about it...)」
 If I let myself continue being so careless, who knows when I'll make another mistake again?
 st00_d06
 v00an0883
 アンジ「I won't force you to do it. But... why don't we calm down a bit first?」
 As she'd suggested, I took a deep breath.
 v01be0666
 ベル「...I'm sorry for everything.」
 st00_d08
 v00an0884
 アンジ「...It's okay. I'm the one who should apologize.」
 I, Angelina, me again, Angelina again.
  We bowed our heads and apologized to each other... four times each, just like that.
 Even though this must look strange to any passers-by, at the fifth time, we both bowed together at the same time―
 st00_d04
 v01be0667a
 ベル「‘I'm sorry.’」
 As we finally raised our heads, our eyes met.
 st00_d00
 v00an0886
 アンジ「...In the past, I wanted to understand your feelings instinctively. From now on, I'll stop guessing and ask you.」
 v01be0668
 ベル「And I'll tell them to you honestly, without hiding anything.」
 st00_d01
 v00an0887
 アンジ「Really?
 It's not like you have to admit every single thing, you know?」
 v01be0669
 ベル「...Yes, I'll remember that.」
 That's right, nothing should be done to extremes.
 st00_d06
 v00an0888
 アンジ「If we consider each other's feelings, we'll have fewer misunderstandings.
  Let's try to have a better relationship.」
 v01be0670
 ベル「...A better relationship?」
 st00_d05
 v00an0889
 アンジ「...Ah, uh, um. I mean... as a performing partner.」
 v01be0671
 ベル「Yes, I'll do my best!」
 st00_d00
 v00an0890
 アンジ「...That's wrong. Since there's two of us, it's not ‘I'll do my best!’, but ‘Let's do our best!’」
 
 As I realized that too, my expression seemed to make her smile.
 Even if it's a conversation of no importance, I felt that I and Angelina had grown closer.
 
 st00_d04
 v00an0891
 アンジ「...Well, it's about time we head back. There's still one more person I have to apologize to.」

 I nodded lightly, and followed behind Angelina on the damp road.
 v01be0672
 ベル「...Um...」
 v00an0892
 アンジ「Yes?」
 v01be0673
 ベル「...Miss Angelina, under the eaves of the inn earlier, you asked if I liked the rain, right?」
 
 v00an0893
 アンジ「...Yeah, I did.」
 v01be0674
 ベル「Today... I liked the rain.」
 I couldn't explain it well, but that was my answer at the moment.
 v00an0894
 アンジ「...I see. I liked it too.」
 After a pause, she agreed.
 I murmured my thanks for that in the bottom of my heart.
 v01be0675
 ベル「(―Thank you.)」
 I turned my eyes towards the sky that had, naturally enough, washed away every one of our problems...

 Heading south from the White Capital will take a little over a day.
 If we could have followed our original plan and gone on the train to Chrome with everyone else, we'd already be taking in the sights there―
 
 v05li0747

 But as it was, from the lowlands of Azo, I could only grumble and gaze at the distant place where I ought to be.

 ライト「―She said ‘I forgot it at the hotel!’ back then!」
 Then made me rush back to the hotel and ask the staff there to search all over for it.
 In the end, I phoned Mom, and when she passed Sis's message on to me... I was speechless.

 With Coco acting so unruffled, I couldn't help but suspect I was the weird one for getting all heated up.

 After thinking about it, I wasn't sure Coco even knew how to ‘get mad.’

 I've been traveling by train up until now, so I'm starting to feel that going by car for a change isn't bad after all.
 In addition, even though going with Silvia and Tonino was awkward at first, because of what had happened in the White Capital...
 
 After talking to them, I realized that they were unexpectedly normal... or perhaps interesting.

 Even though the sound of Silvia's slap was loud, it seemed like she wasn't seriously hitting him, but just playing around.
 
 I couldn't help but feel that if they were like this all the time, they couldn't be bad people.
 
 Also, last night too―
 st06_a00

 トニー「...Y-yeah. Ahaha, hahahahaha...」
 They let me and Coco lodge in a hotel, and said something like ‘we're going to spend the night in the car.’
 The next morning, at the place we planned to meet, I tiptoed quietly up to the car unnoticed―
 st07_a06

 トニー「...That's why I said you should go sleep in the hotel.」

 Even though they said that yesterday, in fact, they never intended to run away.

 トニー「...Yo, boy!
 What's with you, staring at the sky like that?」
 When I was daydreaming about both of them, one of them came over to talk, and I was startled.
 
 I put on a stern face,
 v05li0762

 and reminded him of that.

 Originally?
 Did something go wrong?」
 v05li0765

 I didn't intend to blame him, but an expression of regret appeared upon Tonino's face.
 st07_a07
 v07to0306
 トニー「Sorry. If this car goes too fast... it'll cause a lot of trouble later on. Since it's a restive horse, just like its owner,」
 
 he said unhappily.
 v05li0766
 ライト「(―Did he misunderstand?)」
 In case he had, I decided to apologize.
 v05li0767

 I just didn't feel like talking to Sis. So for now, I was using Mom as our go-between.

 Is there some other reason? If there is, spill the beans and let me help you.」

 It's just one way of putting it.」
 Could it be that he'd smooth-talked Uncle Cero like this as well?
 v05li0770

 I don't think Tonino would suddenly turn into a kidnapper who'd hold me for ransom, anyway.
 
 v05li0771
 ライト「...Then, could you lend me your ear?」
 st07_a08
 v07to0312

 Tonino shouted loudly to Silvia, who was quite a distance away from the car, and pointed to Coco.

 After I replied, Silvia and Coco left.

 ev031h
 v07to0317
 トニー「...Alright, let's have a nice chat.」
 After confirming that both of them were heading in the direction of the village, Tonino straightened his hat again and sat on the hood of the car.
 
 I tried to do the same... but had to hoist myself up, my legs dangling in the air.
 
 v05li0775
 ライト「It's kinda late to say this now, but Tonino, you're pretty tall.」
 v07to0318
 トニー「Hm, really?
 Well, I'm about average, I'd say?」
 ev031c
 Uncle Cero's height is between his and mine, right?
  ...No, no matter how I think about it, I'm the one who's short.

 v05li0776

 ev031g
 v07to0319

 Wait, wait. If I say it like that, I'm pretty old already, huh.」
 
 v05li0777

 ev031h
 v07to0320
 トニー「That might be true. But if I shave it off... it'll feel like I've lost a part of me.」
 
 I tried imagining Tonino without his beard, and laughed at the thought.
 v07to0321
 トニー「Is it really that funny?」
 v05li0778
 ライト「Sorry, sorry!
 But how long have you had that beard?」
 v07to0322
 トニー「Around the same time when I started this line of work... so about five years.」
 v05li0779
 ライト「You've been selling Drops for five years?!」
 
 
 ev031b
 v07to0323
 トニー「No, that was after I started working with Silvia. My original job was as a handyman, which means I do anything.」
 
 v07to0324
 トニー「...It was after meeting Silvia that I started selling Drops.」
 
 
 ev031d
 v05li0780
 ライト「Because it brings in the money?」
 ev031g
 v07to0325
 トニー「...No, quite the opposite. I could even make a mountain out of the Drops that we haven't sold.」
 
 
 
 ev031h
 v07to0326
 トニー「―It'll be a long story, but you want to hear it?」
 v05li0781
 ライト「Yup!」
 It seemed like it would be interesting, so I immediately nodded my head.
 ev031a
 v07to0327
 トニー「...A few years ago, when Silvia was just an apprentice, she had a mentor.」
 v07to0328
 トニー「He was a skilled doll engineer, but when it came to appraising Drops, he was poor indeed.」
 
 
 v07to0329
 トニー「He would always come back having bought some half-baked, second-rate stones, and Silvia would go ‘Ah! You're wasting money again!’」
 
 ...Can the apprentice get mad at the mentor?
 v07to0330
 トニー「―In the end, the stones piled up as the money withered away, and then her mentor left a note saying ‘Sorry!’ and fled in the night...」
 
 v07to0331
 トニー「The only thing that could replace her unpaid wages were those second-rate Drops that were only worth a bit of money.」
 
 
 
 ev031e
 v05li0782
 ライト「...」
 v07to0332
 トニー「And then, looking at her pitiful figure as she tried to sell all those Drops, I decided to start helping her―」
 
 v07to0333
 トニー「But since they were second-rate, we couldn't sell them easily even if we tried, so we tried saving up money to buy some quality Drops and sell them together.」
 
 
 
 ev031f
 v07to0334
 トニー「We had to get a sample of doll-grade Drops, and sell them as if they were those... it wasn't easy..」
 
 
 
 v05li0783
 ライト「You guys did some pretty borderline stuff, huh...」
 v07to0335
 トニー「...Well, yeah. When doing business to earn money, there are always risks that must be taken. Even so, we almost earned back all the money.」
 
 ev031h
 v05li0784
 ライト「Hmm―」
 v07to0336
 トニー「Well, that's all for my story. Let's get to the main topic, shall we, boy?」
 v05li0785
 ライト「...The main topic, eh.」
 What I'd been worrying about was just the question of should I call my sister by phone. If I admitted that, he would definitely tease me.
 
 But, I can't just say nothing―
 v05li0786
 ライト「(―Ah, I got it!)」
 Suddenly, I had a good idea.
 Tonino and Silvia were much older than me.
 And even older than Sis and Uncle Cero.
 ...That's why, even if it's not really a problem, there's something I want to talk about with him.
 black450
 ev031h
 v07to0142
 トニー「...I see. So those two are getting along pretty well.」
 
 
 v05li0687
 ライト「Well yeah. But they've been like that for ages...」
 What I was talking about concerned Cero and my sister.
 From my own point of view, they were already lovers or not far from being there...
 But, in the end, that was just my own perspective.
 
 
 I was interested to know what other people thought.
 ev031b
 v07to0143
 トニー「...I don't really know them that well, but... they do seem to suit each other.」
 v05li0688
 ライト「As I thought, other people can tell too.」
 If even Tonino, who was an outsider, thought that- it must be right.
 Sis and Uncle Cero definitely have something between them.
 v07to0144
 トニー「As a brother, are you bothered by your sister getting snatched away?」
 ev031f
 v05li0689
 ライト「Nope, it's not quite that.」
 v07to0145
 トニー「...Hm?」
 If the one to do it were Cero, I wouldn't have any complaints.
 Honestly, I felt that at least there was someone I could trust with Sis... Rather than just calling them compatible, it's more like they're a perfect fit.
 
 That's why―
 ev031h
 v05li0690
 ライト「My real intention's that I want the two of them to get together quickly.」
 Even though it wasn't nice to be deciding that for Uncle Cero, I hope he'll come to accept it.
 v07to0146
 トニー「Hahaha. So you want to help with their indecision... eh?」
 v05li0691
 ライト「But that's true, right?
 Uncle Cero is a good guy, and there aren't many people who could handle Sis.」
 
 v07to0147
 トニー「...Wow, you're quite blunt about it.」
 That's because, if Sis were more feminine and mature, like Silvia―
 As I thought that, I suddenly wanted to ask him something else.
 ev031d
 v05li0692
 ライト「How about you, Tonino?」
 v07to0148
 トニー「Me?
 Are you asking what I think about it?」
 v05li0693
 ライト「Nah. I'm asking what the relationship between you and Silvia is.」
 ev031h
 v07to0149
 トニー「...Why?
 If Silvia isn't anything to me, you want to go after her?」
 
 As he cleverly shifted the subject with a jocular tone of voice, I felt a bit sullen.
 She was definitely beautiful and charming, but I wouldn't choose somebody just based on their appearance.
 v05li0694
 ライト「...That's impossible, right?
 Only you would be able to take on someone like her.」
 
 v07to0150
 トニー「You're quite the flatterer.」
 Tonino's smirk made me a bit uncomfortable.
 v05li0695
 ライト「...But, I'm sure you agree with that, right?」
 Still, if he doesn't deny it, then it would be the same as admitting he was ‘Silvia's boyfriend’.
 
 ev031a
 v07to0151
 トニー「...Well, yeah. But you know, in reality, things never go quite the way you want them to.」
 
 Tonino sighed, and stared blankly at the sky.
 v07to0152
 トニー「...In the past, I gave her a ring with that feeling in mind.」
 ev031g
 v05li0696
 ライト「Ring?
 Just like the one you're wearing now?」
 I see it whenever he touches his hat- the ring on his right hand.
 A shining band of silver.
 v07to0153
 トニー「That's right, there were a pair of these. And then...」
 Tonino leaned back, and looked straight up towards the sky.
 v07to0154
 トニー「She lost it after a day.」
 That was quite a shocking twist.
 ev031e
 v05li0697
 ライト「...That's, quite, um...」
 Though I wanted to know whether she lost it on the day she received it, or the next day, I guess that doesn't make a difference.
 
 Even someone like me, who's never given a present to anyone I like before, could understand how depressed he must have felt.
 
 v07to0155
 トニー「Even though I tried my best to show that I didn't mind, it was really quite a shock.」
 
 ...Of course.
 v07to0156
 トニー「...In addition, Silvia's never brought up that topic ever again.」
 
 Pursuing the topic wasn't quite tactful, but―
 ev031g
 v05li0698
 ライト「So, did she mind?
 Like, did she feel guilty about it?」
 I believed... that even if it's Silvia, she surely had to have felt guilty about it!

 Tonino raised his hand towards the cigarette on the brim of his hat, but then stopped and shrugged his shoulders.

 v07to0158
 トニー「...My bad, we were going to chat about your problem, but in the end you had to listen to me whining.」
 
 v05li0699
 ライト「No, it's okay.」
 My plan had been to gather information on how Tonino and Silvia get along, then use it as a reference to help Sis.
 But, from what he'd said, it didn't seem like it would be much use.
 
 I decided it's best if we leave it at that and discuss the problem we're facing now.

 I changed the subject, and unexpectedly, Tonino's mood changed with it.

 v07to0159
 トニー「...Well, we'll think of something,」
  he said in his usual carefree tone of voice.
 
 The unease I'd felt yesterday gradually changed to calm.
 
 That's because now I knew that Tonino and Silvia weren't bad people.

 After finishing lunch, I took Coco out for a walk.
 Earlier, the way Coco had gobbled down her food in an instant had been quite something. I thought that's because she liked the taste, but...

 The old woman at the rest stop was shocked at how much Coco ate, and gave me a discount to help. Even so, my purse had gotten a lot lighter.

 シルヴ「Um, ah, I'll give you a share of mine too, okay?」
 As she put on that pitiful expression, I couldn't bring myself to be strict with her.
 v06si1441
 シルヴ「(―Should I tune her to make her feel like she's already full before taking her to dinner?)」
 I knew that was being stingy, but there was nothing else I could do.
 If that doesn't work, the only solution left will be to make her fall asleep until we meet up with Cero and the others.

 v06si1442
 シルヴ「Fine, fine. Don't go too far into the forest, okay?」
 This kid's full of energy to the extent you need to look out for her.
 
 
  If I just take my eyes off for a second, who knows where she'll run off.
 I'm sure it must cause Cero a lot of trouble.

 ココ「Wanna play, hide and, seek―?」
 v06si1443
 シルヴ「Just the two of us?
 If we play, it's better to wait for the other two...」
 I explained, checking my watch.
  If we went back now, I wonder if Tonino and Light would still be around the car?
 Even if they are, we would just be taking their spot as they went to get some food.
 v06si1444
 シルヴ「I've got the car keys. And it wouldn't be nice to disturb them, so let's leave the hide and seek for next time, okay?」

 v06si1447
 シルヴ「Th-that's...」
 A boy just growing up, asking a guy like Tonino for a ‘man-to-man talk’―
 
 v06si1448
 シルヴ「Nah, I guess it's okay. It's got nothing to do with you, so forget about it.」
 ...I'm the one who should forget about it!
 st02_b06
 v02co1693
 ココ「Kay, I'll forget, it―」
 v06si1449
 シルヴ「...You make it sound like you really can forget on command.」
 I couldn't help but laugh. But I had a lingering feeling of unease, so I asked her.
 v06si1450
 シルヴ「Do you remember what you were talking about with me just now?」
 st02_a05
 v02co1694
 ココ「Hm?
 What was it―?」
 v06si1451
 シルヴ「Don't tell me you really...」
 Does she have some function to forget anything she's told?
 How can such a dangerous instruction be initiated just by casual conversation―
 st02_a01
 v02co1695
 ココ「Something, weird―?」
 v06si1452

 v06si1453
 シルヴ「...?」
 st02_a02
 v02co1697
 ココ「I'll forget, some day.」
 ―She'll forget about it someday in the future.
  Somehow her words made me feel sad for a moment.
 ...But after thinking about it...
 v06si1454
 シルヴ「Well, that's a truth in life.」
 st02_a03
 v02co1698
 ココ「Truth in, life―?」
 v06si1455
 シルヴ「That's right, a truth in life. Something that would never change, something you can call ‘normal’.」
 And then, I suddenly remembered one of the reasons I'd become a doll engineer.
 
 v06si1456
 シルヴ「...Where were you born, Coco?」
 st02_a07
 v02co1699
 ココ「Where, I wonder. I don't, know―」
 v06si1457
 シルヴ「―I see.」
 st02_b02
 v02co1700
 ココ「How about, Via―?」
 v06si1458
 シルヴ「―I was born south of the Red Capital. It may seem like boasting for me to say it myself, but my family was pretty wealthy.」
 
 st02_a02
 v02co1701
 ココ「Um um.」
 Though Coco was nodding, I couldn't tell if she really understood. Still, she made a good victim to unload the story of my life onto.
 
 v06si1459
 シルヴ「...Nobody kept me in line while I was growing up, so my personality became a bit twisted.」
 st02_a03
 v02co1702
 ココ「Twisted?」
 v06si1460
 シルヴ「...Yup, I was so spoiled that I still feel ashamed about it whenever I remember.」
 st02_b02
 v02co1703
 ココ「Like―, me―?」
 Coco placed her hands on her waist, and bend her body right and left, trying to become ‘twisted.’
 
 v06si1461
 シルヴ「Ahahaha, not my body, but my heart.」
 If Tonino were the one doing that as some lame gag, I would beat him to the ground, but faced with this kid I could only smile weakly.
 
 v06si1462
 シルヴ「―Well, there was a Sister in my house. I really loved her a lot...」
 
 
 
 v06si1463
 シルヴ「But then once, she was unwell, and I didn't notice that it was because there were flaws in her Drops.」
 
 
 
 I knew that Sisters wouldn't complain even if they were unhappy, so I didn't let her go for tuning, and even brought her everywhere with me.
 
 
 
 Since if she went for tuning, she would be away for two weeks. I was still a child, so I didn't like that, and refused to let her leave my side―
 
 v06si1464
 シルヴ「But when the symptoms became clear, it was already too late to save her.」
 st02_a04
 v02co1704
 ココ「...Did she, die?」
 v06si1465
 シルヴ「...Yeah. The engineer told me that she could still move again if we changed all her Drops to new ones.」
 
 
 
 v06si1466
 シルヴ「―But her memories were lost forever.」
 I had cried when the doll engineer who treated her had said that. Back then, I realized for the first time... that there are things money can't buy.
 
 v06si1467
 シルヴ「With that memory close to my heart, I chose this profession when I became an adult.」
 
 v06si1468
 シルヴ「―Even though this art is almost extinct and will never make me rich... my memories still tell me this is the right path for me.」
 
 And yet... I had already forgotten the principles that made me become a doll engineer, and continued to live an incurable lifestyle.
 
 v06si0102
 シルヴ「...I'm sorry about what happened earlier.」
 Even though it's a bit late, I wanted to take this chance to apologize to Coco.
 st02_a01
 v02co1539
 ココ「Whoa―?」
 But in response, she opened her mouth wide, and looked up at me with a tilted head.
 v06si0103
 シルヴ「...You know, faking that gunshot to threaten you.」

 ココ「Oh―!」
 v06si0105
 シルヴ「I really didn't mean you any harm, you know.」
 Even though I couldn't say the same thing about pointing the gun at Coco, I hadn't intended to fire it either.
 It's just that I was afraid of facing others head-on... Still, I felt ashamed to even make that excuse.
 
 Shouldn't I be the one looking out for the Sisters?
 
 
 v06si0106
 シルヴ「...Anyway, I'm sorry!
 I'm really sorry!」
 st02_a02
 v02co1542

 v06si0107

 v06si0108
 シルヴ「Man, I'm the one asking. No imitating me.」
 st02_a06
 v02co1544
 ココ「Ehehe―」
 She's driving me crazy, but it seems like she didn't really care.
 ...Rather than believing she's really that forgiving, it's more like she lacks a sense of danger.
 st02_b00

 ココ「Hey―, Via―. Do the, Bang―」
 v06si0109
 シルヴ「...By ‘Bang’, do you mean the gun?」
 st02_b06
 v02co1546
 ココ「Yup, yup. Bang―」
 Not only her appearance, but her mind is that of a child.
 The person who created Coco probably didn't want to create a doll that just resembled a human.
 
 
 
 ―Maybe he did it because he wanted to create a ‘child.’
 v06si0110
 シルヴ「...Sure, I got it. But no real guns. Are finger guns good enough?」
 st02_a10
 v02co1547

 I smiled and aimed at Coco with my index finger.
 While Coco waited with gleaming eyes, anticipating my signal.
 
 v06si0111
 シルヴ「Bang―!」
 st02_a09
 v02co1548
 ココ「U―, wah―」
 Coco fell back to the floor with a thud.
 The incident at the White Capital flashed through my mind, and honestly... it pained my heart.
 v06si0112
 シルヴ「Alright, that's all. You'll catch a cold if you keep lying down.」
 st02_a03
 v02co1549
 ココ「Eh―?」
  Coco got up slowly, her eyebrows creasing in disappointment.
 v06si0113
 シルヴ「If you really want to, then let's play another game.」
 st02_b02
 v02co1550
 ココ「Then―, duel game―」
 Where did she even learn that word?
 v06si0114
 シルヴ「...That isn't much different from what we just did.」
 Even if I pointed that out, I couldn't really refuse a child's request.
 v06si0115
 シルヴ「...Fine. I'll play along, but only three times, okay?」
 I agreed to play with her, if only a little.
 st02_a10
 v02co1551
 ココ「Yah, hoo―」

 We agreed that the rules were to stand close, back to back, then start walking for ten steps. Then we'll turn around, and the first one to be shot would fall.
 
 ...But when the game really started, things didn't go that smoothly.
 The first time, after walking ten steps, I turned back and saw Coco standing right behind me staring at me. This was invalid, since she followed me.
 
 
 The second time, after turning back and aiming my finger at her, Coco was eagerly waiting to be shot... I won, but it was no hard-earned victory.
 
 
 The third time, I went over it with her again, and we dueled once more― 
 v06si0116
 シルヴ「...Five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten!」
 I spun around in an exaggerated fashion, and saw Coco's hands waving around as if she were unloading a pair of six-shooters everywhere.

 ココ「When is, Cero's, birthday―?」
 v06si0119

 As revenge, I wanted to ask her when Tonino's birthday was, but that didn't seem very mature―
 
 v06si0120
 シルヴ「How much is six plus four?」
 v02co1554
 st02_a03
 ココ「Um, um... it's ten!」
 I limited the math questions to those she could solve by counting her fingers.
 It felt a little heartwarming, learning from each other like this.

 st02_a01
 v02co1555
 ココ「For―?」
 v06si0122

 Even though I was only certified as a novice, I thought I was pretty competent.
 
 st02_b00

 ココ「Oh―. The same, as Gramps?」

 There aren't many engineers nowadays, so the one she knew must have been pretty old.

 v06si0126

 Coco happily spun around, but after doing so, she was back facing me again. How pointless.
 
 Well, I guess I'll just have to go behind her to continue the check-up.

 シルヴ「Come on, turn to the side.」
 From her appearance, it doesn't seem like there was anything amiss with her.
 Her joints didn't creak, and were very well maintained.
 v06si0128
 シルヴ「...Still, this design is amazing.」
 The simplicity of her structure reflected the high precision of the creator's technique.
 It was a pleasure to behold, both aesthetically and technically.
 
 Even though I couldn't tell when she had been created, it must have been an innovative design at the time.
 
 v06si0129
 シルヴ「...But, you're not all that way.」
 v02co1560
 ココ「What, way―?」
 The engineer who created this child had placed a huge amount of work into her core personality.
 
 v06si0130
 シルヴ「If not, he couldn't have made such a strange kid.」
 ...That was meant to be a compliment.

 ev032h
 v06si0131

 If I talk too much, though, I can't focus on tuning.
 I shifted my mood, and pulled Coco's hand to draw her closer.

 シルヴ「Alright, close your eyes.」
 v02co1562

 I started to gently adjust her, and read her senses.

 ...It must be that she was tuned by someone else not long ago.
 v06si0134
 シルヴ「...That's enough, you can open your eyes.」
 black450
 ev032e
 The result of the checkup were that her body was perfectly healthy.
 
 Her Drops were in the bottle upon her chest, so I didn't need to strip her to examine them.
 
 
 v06si0135
 シルヴ「Well, it's about time we go back to where those guys are.」
 If we continue to fool around any more, the sun will set on us.
 Before that happens, we need to go look for somewhere to stay the night.
 I would never accept four people camping out in the open in a car!
 Also... If I don't take a bath today, I'll feel too disgusting to fall asleep.

 Still, something like this is okay once in a while, I suppose?
 Recently, I'd been stressed out all the time, and she'd done wonders for that.

 I looked forward, and left and right, but there was nobody there.

 Cero must be angry because I went for a stroll without asking.

 Granny said I mustn't remove both of my gloves at the same time.

  ...I'm sorry. I can't remember clearly.

 Is she going to eat her?

 シルヴ「Who would like these ones? That's not it. I'm just checking her Drops.」
 
 
 
 I didn't know the reason, but Silvia grinned.
 ...Still, her hands were amazing.
  She touched Flora with a pop, pop, pop-

 シルヴ「Well, it might be because of my tweaking just now, but this is already quite a fine display of engineering. Even surpassing my mentor.」
 
 Silvia laughed like she was really happy.
 st06_a00
 v06si0149
 シルヴ「...Ah, I found the problem!
 This over here looks off.」
 v02co1571

 She pulled out something from under Flora's skirt.
 st06_a08
 v06si0150
 シルヴ「Found the treasure―!
 This is pretty ancient, but looks like it's a Speech Stone.」
 v02co1572

 In the past, Gramps said something about checking my Speech Stone... what did he do then?

  If you aren't careful, it might turn out like last time.」
 st06_a06
 v06si0154
 シルヴ「...Here's a handkerchief. Give me the hand that isn't gloved.」
 Silvia covered my right hand with the handkerchief.
  And then, she placed the stone from Flora on top of it.
 v02co1575
 ココ「...This?」
 st06_a08
 v06si0155
 シルヴ「That's right... just like that. Yeah!」
 v02co1576
 ココ「Ah―?」
 When I was looking at the stone, Silvia took the chance and snatched the glove off my left hand.

 Just when Silvia reached to grab my hand―
 v02co1578
 ココ「Ah―, it's falling―」
 The stone on my palm almost fell!
 v02co1579
 ココ「Awawaa―」
 I hurriedly reached both my hands to catch the stone.
 But this time, Silvia was one step quicker.

  And caught it single-handedly.

 On the train to Vermilion,
 Silvia said that Coco needed tuning, so she chose a car without many people in it and occupied the box seat at the far end.
 
 The reason seemed to be that she was worried about affecting Belle, but...
 st01_a04
 v01be0676
 ベル「I don't think it will cause any problems even if I'm around during Coco's tuning...」
 
  said Belle.
 After what happened at Aubergine, I felt a bit uneasy leaving it to Silvia... I mentioned that out loud, but Angelina shook her head.

 Angelina shot me a mischievous look, and smirked at the pout on my face.

 アンジ「Ufufu, I was joking. I'm sure she just don't want anyone to disturb her so she can focus on her job, or something... right?」
 
 v03wa1501
 ワカバ「...I see.」
 After she said that, I tried to take her word for it, but―
 v03wa1502
 ワカバ「(―I'm worried even so!)」
 Once I realized that, I was restless.

 I went over to Silvia, mentally prepared to be shooed away.

 st06_a00
 v06si0501
 シルヴ「Oh, I see. Then sit beside me.」
 She was friendlier than I'd expected, as she invited me to sit. I let of a sigh of relief, and started asking questions.
 v03wa1504
 ワカバ「...How's Coco doing?」
 st06_a03
 v06si0502
 シルヴ「Well. It's like she's lost all her energy.」
 face02_a01
 v02co1734
 ココ「Hm―?
 Kaba―?」
 Even though Coco was calling me ‘Kaba’ in the usual way, her voice lacked life.
 
 Was I worrying too much? Her eyes seem to look a little empty.
 v03wa1505
 ワカバ「...So is she in a bad condition after all?」
 st06_a04
 v06si0503
 シルヴ「Well, you can think of it as if she's only half-awake.」
 v03wa1506
 ワカバ「Hey, what happened in Chrome?」
 According to what I had heard before I got on the train, Coco had become that way after she'd tuned her before we left Chrome.
 
 st06_a03
 v06si0504
 シルヴ「Uh, um. It's pretty hard to explain.」
 v03wa1507
 ワカバ「Could it be that you did something to Coco again...」
 st06_a02
 v06si0505
 シルヴ「Wait a second!
 I just meant to tune Coco, but accidents happen... nobody can predict the future, you know?」
 
 v03wa1508
 ワカバ「...U, um. But... Silvia, you did put that weird Drop into Coco's bottle, remember?」
 
 
 
 Silvia was the one who gave the Drop to Coco, causing her personality to shift completely and resulting in a frenzied ruckus.
 
 
 
 st06_a07
 v06si0506
 シルヴ「Ugh, if you put it like that...」
 Silvia, normally so full of confidence, looked troubled for once.
 st06_a03
 v06si0507
 シルヴ「...I wonder if I'm fundamentally incompatible with Coco?
 Does she hate me?」
 face02_a03

 ココ「Ma―, too, Fa―, too. I like, everyone.」
 st06_a00
 v06si0509

 Ma― was referring to Angelina, while Fa― was Belle.
 v03wa1509
 ワカバ「(―Hey, Coco. What about me...?)」
 face02_a04
 v02co1737
 ココ「...I like, Kaba―」
 v03wa1510
 ワカバ「Eh, ehehe. Thank you.」
 It sounded as if she said it straight from her heart, which made me happy, but there was something sad about it too. Could it be that she said it because I kept staring at her?
 
 v03wa1511
 ワカバ「A-anyways!
 For now, we can only count on you, Silvia.」
 It's a bit weird for me to say that when I was the one depressed about it, but since Rein isn't around, I could only leave it to her.
 
 v03wa1512
 ワカバ「So, honestly... how does it look?
 Will she be like this forever?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0510
 シルヴ「No, I don't think so. I think she just needs some time to return to her usual self.」
 
 v03wa1513
 ワカバ「...About how long?」
 st06_a03
 v06si0511
 シルヴ「Judging from the progress I'm making with this tuning, probably about half a day...」
 st06_a04
 v06si0512
 シルヴ「―Even if it takes longer than expected, I'll think of something before we all meet up at Vermilion.」
 
 v03wa1514
 ワカバ「...I'll leave it to you, then.」
 I patted Coco's head, and was about to head back to where Angelina and the others were.
 
 ...But.
 st06_a05
 v06si0513
 シルヴ「Ah, wait!
 There's something I want to ask you.」
 v03wa1515
 ワカバ「What is it?」
 As I turned around at the sound of her voice, she got up from her seat, came into the hallway where I was and whispered to me.
 
 st06_a06
 v06si0514
 シルヴ「...Hey, do you know who ‘Dua’ is?」
 v03wa1516
 ワカバ「Huh?
 Dua?」
 st06_a02
 v06si0515
 シルヴ「Shh, you're too loud!
 Coco can hear you!」
 I didn't know why, but it seemed like she didn't want Coco to hear our conversation.
 
 So I whispered back to Silvia.
 v03wa1517
 ワカバ「Do you mean ‘that’ Dua?」
 st06_a05
 v06si0516
 シルヴ「...I don't know what you mean by ‘that’ either...」
 Silvia looked blankly at me. It seemed like she really didn't know.
 v03wa1518
 ワカバ「Don't you mean the Hero of the White Kingdom― the Lady Knight Dua who sacrificed herself to protect Christina?」
 
 st06_a04
 v06si0517
 シルヴ「Ah―, I see!
 No wonder I felt like I'd heard that name before!
  I learned that ages ago in history class. Yup, yup.」
 v03wa1519
 ワカバ「...Ages ago, eh?」
 st06_a12
 v06si0518
 シルヴ「Wait, what?
 Not really that long ago, you know.
  Just a couple of years. Ohohoho!」
 ―You're the one who said it.
 v03wa1520
 ワカバ「...But, why ask about that?」
 st06_a00
 v06si0519
 シルヴ「Eh?
 Ah, err. Well, it was just bugging me. There are times when you remember a name, but nothing about who it belonged to.」
 There are definitely times like that, but from the flow of this conversation... 
 (―Well, whatever...)
 (―She's being suspicious...)
 v03wa1521
 ワカバ「(―She's being suspicious...)」
 Judging from the concerned expression on Silvia's face when she'd mentioned Dua's name, it was not something so simple as trying to remember somebody.
 
 st06_a02
 v06si0520
 シルヴ「...W-what's with that look of suspicion?」
 And to call for me to stop just to ask something like that... she must be hiding something.
 v03wa1522
 ワカバ「I'll forgive you if you're honest with me, okay?」
 st06_a05
 v06si0521
 シルヴ「What about?」
 v03wa1523
 ワカバ「Why are you curious about the name Dua?
 And why didn't you want Coco to hear?」
 
 st06_a03
 v06si0522
 シルヴ「...That's because...」
 Watching her stammer, I leaned close to pressure her, but with unexpected frankness,
 
 st06_a00
 v06si0523
 シルヴ「That's because Coco mentioned that name.」
  she replied.
 v03wa1524
 ワカバ「...Coco did?
 Why?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0524
 シルヴ「Who knows?
 I asked you because I didn't understand.」
 v03wa1525
 ワカバ「I'm not Coco, so I wouldn't know. Rather than me, you should just go ask Coco herself―」
 
 st06_a02
 v06si0525
 シルヴ「Alright, stop. I want to do that too, but that has to wait.」
 Silvia silently mouthed ‘I understand that, but’, then―
 st06_a06
 v06si0526
 シルヴ「Since I've already started the tuning, if I ask her now, it might affect her,」
  she said.
 st06_a03
 v06si0527
 シルヴ「Also, the problem isn't that simple. It's quite a long story...」
 v03wa1526
 ワカバ「...?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0528
 シルヴ「Rather than you, there's someone else I have to explain this matter to.」
 She gazed in the direction of the neighboring train car. 
 v03wa1527
 ワカバ「―Hmm.」
 Did she mean Angelina? Or Belle?
  Whoever it was, it wasn't me.
 v03wa1528
 ワカバ「(―Oh, well.)」
 I was just curious why Silvia had mentioned Dua's name.
 
 v03wa1529
 ワカバ「(―Ah, but speaking of Dua...)」
 Even though we planned for that character to appear in the play, we haven't found a suitable actress―
 v03wa1530
 ワカバ「Ah, I got it!」
 st06_a05
 v06si0529
 シルヴ「...Hm?」
 Why didn't I notice this sooner!
  Someone suitable to play the courageous female knight is right in front of me!
 
 v03wa1531
 ワカバ「...Hey, Silvia. Do you want to act as Dua?」
 v03wa1532
 ワカバ「(―Well, whatever...)」
  Thinking too hard is a pain.
 Even if Silvia is suddenly interested in Dua, the amazing hero, it has nothing to do with me.
 
 v03wa1533
 ワカバ「(―Nothing to do with me, but...)」
 I'd suddenly had a great idea.
 v03wa1534
 ワカバ「He-y, Silvia.」
 st06_a02
 v06si0530
 シルヴ「W-what?
 What's with that disgusting tone of voice?
 Are you sweet-talking the wrong person?」
 
 v03wa1535
 ワカバ「What's with you!?
 I've never spoken to Cero with this kind of voice before!」
 
 st06_a08
 v06si0531
 シルヴ「...Hmm. I never said who that wrong person was, you know.」
 v03wa1536
 ワカバ「Nnggh!」
 st06_a01
 v06si0532
 シルヴ「I see, so it's Cero―」
 Why do I have to be teased by her!?
 v03wa1537
 ワカバ「G-gaahhh!
 That's nothing to do with this! 
 Forget about it immediately!」
 st06_a04
 v06si0533
 シルヴ「Even if you say that, your insistence only makes it harder for me to forget. Ufufufu―」
 
 Silvia laughed mischievously. 
 But then her expression suddenly returned to a serious one.
 st06_a00
 v06si0534
 シルヴ「...So, what is it?」
  she asked, as if nothing had happened just now.
 v03wa1538
 ワカバ「Well, I was talking about Dua earlier. If you'd like, do you want to?」
 
 st06_a05
 v06si0535
 シルヴ「Hah?
 Want to what?」
 v03wa1539
 ワカバ「I said, Dua. You as Dua.」
 st06_a07
 v06si0536
 シルヴ「...Has anyone ever told you that you're bad at explaining things?」
 Silvia placed her hands on her waist and sighed heavily.
 Now that she mentions it, it was a failure when I tried to persuade Angelina as well.
 v03wa1540
 ワカバ「Then listen clearly, okay?
 I want you to play the role of Dua in our play. How about that?」
 
 st06_a03
 v06si0537
 シルヴ「...Even if you ask me that, I don't know anything about this Dua character.」
 
 v03wa1541
 ワカバ「It's okay!
 Dua is the female knight of the White Kingdom, she's the master swordsman that protects Princess Christina. Look, doesn't that suit you!」
 
 st06_a06
 v06si0538
 シルヴ「I'm confident in my shooting skills, but I've never used a sword before.」
 v03wa1542
 ワカバ「There's no problem!
 Dua never really draws her sword or fights with anyone on stage.」
 
 st06_a03
 v06si0539
 シルヴ「Hmm, it does sound interesting, but...」
 Sounds interesting?
  She seems tempted, I have to keep persuading her!
 v03wa1543
 ワカバ「You can do it! ...No, more like there's nobody but you that can do it!」
 st06_a04
 v06si0540
 シルヴ「...R-really?
 But I'm not like Tonino. I've never performed in a play before, you know?」
 
 v03wa1544
 ワカバ「Huh?」
 v06si0541
 シルヴ「Seems like you want someone with more experience.」
 v03wa1545
 ワカバ「No, that's not what I meant.
  Did you just say ‘different from Tonino’?」
 st06_a05
 v06si0542
 シルヴ「Yeah, I did... A-ah, wait a minute. Forget what I said!」
 v03wa1546
 ワカバ「Impossible!
 As a scriptwriter hungry for actors, how could I just forget about that?」
 
 st06_a04
 v06si0543
 シルヴ「Y-your eyes are pretty scary.」
 v03wa1547
 ワカバ「U―hu―hu―hu―hu―」
 v03wa1548
 ワカバ「Hehe. When I told you the same thing earlier, didn't you say ‘I can't forget it!’ as well?」
 
 After exacting my revenge, I poked her in the stomach.
 st06_a03
 v06si0544
 シルヴ「...Ugh」
 v03wa1549
 ワカバ「(―G-guh...)」
 Even though this has nothing to do with the present topic, that great body of hers really frustrates me.
 B-but... One day, I'll become like her too―
 v03wa1550
 ワカバ「Anyway!
 I'm never gonna forget that. How could I forget!」
 Even though I don't know how much acting experience he has, as long as he has some, I'll give him a warm welcome!
 In addition, we're going to meet up with Tonino in Vermilion soon. I'm not going to let him run away!
 
 v03wa1551
 ワカバ「Hey, hey!
 If it's Tonino, he comes with Silvia like a set, right?」
 
 st06_a02
 v06si0545
 シルヴ「Hey, you know. We just work together, so don't put us on the same level, okay? I'm in charge, and he's my lackey. I keep him because he's useful, and that's it.」
 
 
 
 v03wa1552
 ワカバ「Yup.」
 st06_a03
 v06si0546
 シルヴ「...Other people can see it however they like, but we aren't dating each other or anything. You got that?」
 
 v03wa1553
 ワカバ「I-I see. Then, there isn't any problem, is there?」
 I didn't understand why she denied that so seriously.
 v03wa1554
 ワカバ「I'd really appreciate it if Tonino would perform. And if you're in charge, then things will be easier.」
 
 st06_a11
 v06si0547
 シルヴ「...H-hey. What I was trying to say is, I'm not especially close with that guy, but you guys keep putting me together with him...」
 
 
 Silvia was confused, and seemed not to understand what was she saying. 
 
 v03wa1555
 ワカバ「Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down―」
 st06_a09
 v06si0548
 シルヴ「I'm not a horse!」
 v03wa1556
 ワカバ「Then, how about this?
 First, I'll try and persuade Tonino to perform. If he can't decide...」
 
 st06_a06
 v03wa1557
 ワカバ「I hope that you'll encourage him a bit.」
 v03wa1558
 ワカバ「―Of course, I wouldn't force you. But, I really don't want to let a chance like this slip past me. Please!」
 
 Even though I didn't know why he started acting, his circumstances at the moment...
  or pretty much anything about him.
 But, if he has even a little interest in standing on the stage―
 v03wa1559

 As the car slowed down, I asked that question to the two in the back seat.

 Light had his face and hands against the window, while Cero was unfolding a map to confirm our location.
 
 v07to0339
 トニー「(―Man, with the three of us here it's such a sausage fest...)」
 I muttered to myself as I looked at the rear-view mirror.
 Originally, Silvia would have been in the passenger seat, while the bag full of Drops we were going to sell would be in the back seat―
 
 
 
 But now, my partner Silvia had to travel to Chrome with the other group, and in exchange I get those two guys sitting in the back seat.

 シルヴ「That's right!
 Finding that will be your job.」

 トニー「(―That's what it should have been like.)」
 In the end, by the time we found out ‘forgetting the draft’ had just been a misunderstanding, it was already evening. 
 
 As a result, I have to bring these two left here by that little lady's mistake down south, a different route from the other group that went via Chrome―

 What's Azo famous for?」
 v07to0343
 トニー「Hm?
 In Azo?
 There isn't really much it's known for...」
 v07to0344
 トニー「―Well, it was a gathering place for doll engineers a long time ago. I think I heard Silvia say that before.」
 
 st05_a05

 Light, who had gotten out of the car first, turned to ask Cero that.
 face04_a01
 v04ce1491
 セロ「...Yeah. It's true that there were a lot of doll engineers in Azo.」
 face04_a06
 v04ce1492

 st05_a08

 Something like that is a piece of cake to him.」
 
 Light said proudly, as if it were himself he were boasting about.
 st05_a05

 ライト「But, he's not good at math,」
  he added, quite unnecessarily.
 face04_a08

 Cero turned his head away with a subtle expression of embarrassment as he acknowledged Light's tactless comment.

 I felt like he'd never earn a living wage with that kind of specialty.

  ...So the saying ‘like father, like son’ is true.」
 black450
 v07to0348
 トニー「(―Even I've been through those times... days where I thought the same way as he did.)」
 Back then, I was still young, so I thought taking after my father's profession was natural.
 
 Of course, that presumption was baseless.
 I was an ignorant brat who knew nothing about the real world, I just wanted to get rich and let my mother have a better life... those were my cliche aspirations.
 
 And so, I left home to learn from my father who lived separately, leaving just a note behind when I left. But―
 
 v07to0349
 トニー「(―I realized soon that I couldn't get along with him, and couldn't endure his strict training.)」
 After running away from there, and pulling through until now... here sits that useless man who gave up halfway.
 Within my body, the blood flowing in my veins from my mother's side was definitely thicker.
 Otherwise, I would have gotten along with my dad, even though he left Mother―

 Light had an unusually serious expression as he entered the conversation.
  ...I wouldn't want him to become the person I am today.
 v07to0351
 トニー「To follow him or not is your own choice. What's your dad's profession, boy?」

 v07to0352

 After Cero mentioned that, I understood why he had said that his father ‘was’ a historian.

 ライト「Who knows?
 Sis insists that she's going to be a novelist, so I ought to, I guess?」
 
 Light has yet to reach any crossroads in life. There is still a chance that he'll consider another path.
 
 However, what I want to tell him isn't that, but...
 v07to0355
 トニー「...You have to think about it by yourself, but I'll give you a piece of advice.」
 v07to0356
 トニー「Once you've decided, you must have the resolution to stick with it, no matter how painful it is.」
 
 v07to0357

 That's rude of you to Mr. Tonino...」
 st05_a05
 v07to0358
 トニー「Hahaha!
 It's okay, it's okay.」
 For me, being made into a bad example to warn others is as common as a square meal.
 ...My dad used to tell me―
 v07to0359
 トニー「‘At best you'll become a side character, you'll never be the main character.’」
  something like that.
 The only thing I was praised for is my ‘sense of improvisation,’ and I was told it was impossible for me to make a living on the real stage.
 
 v07to0360
 トニー「...Anyway, I'm hungry, let's go get something to eat.」
 st05_a01

 You take the lead, and search for a cheap and tasty restaurant.」

 Should we meet up back at the car?」

 After seeing Light run off, full of energy, Cero and I started walking leisurely.
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1498
 セロ「...So, Mr. Tonino, do you like traveling?」
 v07to0364
 トニー「Hm?
 Well, there are things I like about it... but why ask that all of a sudden?」
 st04_a01
 v04ce1499
 セロ「Nah, I just thought that maybe you chose a job that has a lot of driving around like this because you like traveling.」
 
 v07to0365
 トニー「Hahahaha, that's a nice excuse!
 I'll use that from now on.」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1500
 セロ「E-eh?」
 v07to0366
 トニー「If I use your reasoning that I ‘like traveling’ as justification, it might make my wandering life sound a bit cooler.」
 
 Since I didn't have a place to return to, drifting around aimlessly was perfect for me.
 Even though I didn't choose for myself that I should travel all around the place, unknowingly, I've broadened my horizons because of it.
 
 Even if I just pass by the cities and villages, as long as I can recall the things that I've seen with my own eyes, the experiences I've had...
 
 v07to0367
 トニー「(―At least I've gathered quite a few stories from my travels.)」
 I've been doing this job for five years, and partnering with Silvia for a little less than three years.
 Still, it's already too late for me to return to my hometown.
 v07to0368
 トニー「Hey, Cero. So, are you planning to follow after your father?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1501

 I'm still a little troubled over it.」
 v07to0369
 トニー「Do you have something else you want to do?」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1502
 セロ「...Actually, I've been thinking of becoming a doll engineer for Coco's sake.」
 Coco?
 Ah, that Schwester that dueled with Silvia!
 
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce1503
 セロ「Every year, the number of engineers capable of giving Sisters maintenance and tuning is decreasing.」
 
 
 
 st04_a07
 v04ce1504
 セロ「...If something were to happen to her, and there's nobody nearby to treat her...」
 
 v07to0370
 トニー「Then it would be better if you had been an engineer... that's what you're thinking, right?」
 
 st04_a06
 v04ce1505
 セロ「...Yes.」
 Becoming a doctor himself, in consideration of the risk of his family falling sick.
 v07to0371
 トニー「So there are people who think that way...」
 Even so, not everyone is cut out to be a doctor. Some people just don't have the inclination.
 
 Still, unlike with doctors, if his goal is to be one of those doll engineers that so few people choose to become, he'll be welcomed by the people of that field.
 
 v07to0372
 トニー「...Which means, rather than you ‘want to become one,’ it's more like ‘you have no choice but to become one,’ right?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1506
 セロ「That's right, it's about time I decided my future.」
 v07to0373
 トニー「...I see, seems like you have it tough.」
 From the perspective of a person living with a Schwester, that Schwester is also a member of the family.
 
 
  This isn't a problem that an outsider like me can just give his own opinion.
 st04_a04
 v04ce1507
 セロ「But, I'm starting to sort it out. I guess I should aim to be a historian after all.」
 
 v07to0374
 トニー「What's your reason for thinking that way?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1508
 セロ「First, I should do what I want to do.」
 A realistic, down-to-earth way of thinking.
 st04_a01
 v04ce1509
 セロ「...Also, I now realize that there are younger engineers like Miss Silvia around.」
 
 v07to0375
 トニー「No, wait. Don't base your conclusions on her. You saw what happened at Aubergine, right?」
 
 st04_a04
 v04ce1510
 セロ「...Yeah, that was quite... But I think her actual skills wouldn't be that poor.」
 ...Don't just make a baseless guess like that. No wonder you're so easily cheated.
 st04_a00
 v04ce1511
 セロ「Well, how good would you say Miss Silvia actually is?」
 v07to0376
 トニー「I-I'm not really a professional in the field of Schwesters, so I can't really say, but I guess she's just good enough.」
 
 
 
 st04_a01
 v04ce1512
 セロ「Then there's no problem.」
 Cero really is a youngster that doesn't know what it means to be skeptical of others.
  ...But this feeling of knowing that you're trusted isn't unpleasant.
 st04_a04
 v04ce1513
 セロ「Also, if Silvia is willing to help treat Coco, the fee for that can be deducted away from the money you owe us.」
 
 v07to0377

 I didn't expect that such a natural plan of repaying our debt would come from this conversation.

 I took off my hat, turned it over, and showed them the roll of money wrapped in rubber bands hidden inside.

 Are you planning to blackmail me too, Cero?」

 セロ「Well, I was just thinking, could the ‘cleaning fee’ you got at the Aubergine bar be a portion of that...」
 
 v07to0386
 トニー「(―He even figured that out too...)」
 He might be gullible, but he isn't dumb.
 He had never even mentioned that since we met again in the White Capital, so I thought he had already forgotten about it.
 
 v07to0387
 トニー「Still, you looked really cool when you got hit by that tomato!」

 v04ce1522

 Belle, who should have been the one to receive treatment, had not gotten better. And due to a misunderstanding, Coco had gone berserk instead.
 Lastly, they'd run away and taken the money with them... seeing what they'd done, it was natural to draw that conclusion.
 st05_a00
 v05li0811

 Since Wakaba was the cause of all this trouble originally.

 Taking that into account, Sis really screwed up this time.」
 v04ce1524
 セロ「...Ah, ahahahahaha. There's no arguing otherwise, I suppose.」
 But we had overlooked one thing, the greatest victims of this incident... were not us, but Tonino and Silvia.
 The two of them might not think so, but we definitely caused them a lot of trouble.
 
 v04ce1525
 セロ「(―He's not only taken us along, but he's even paying our way.)」
 Not only the food and lodging fee earlier, he'd also paid for the gasoline, parking fee, and the maintenance for the car.
 
 Tonino must really regret what happened at Aubergine- that's why he wants to do this as an apology to us.
 
 But, we can't keep relying on his kindness.

 Not only are they helping us with our own error, that we'd cause even more of a burden for them was something my conscience couldn't allow.

 I was talking about Tonino, but Light, on the other hand...

 We both laughed together, then paused for breath.

 I didn't understand what he was asking all of a sudden.

 Light frowned unhappily, and kicked a small stone by his foot.
  It was pitch black beyond the inn, so the stone flew away and vanished in an instant.
 If you had asked me, I would have preferred the conversation ended at that, but―
 
 v04ce1536
 セロ「Why did you think we were going out?」
 I wasn't sure why, but I asked Light that question.
 st05_a02

 As far as anyone else is concerned, there's no other possibility.」
 v04ce1537

 That was a matter of course, since I've never seen Wakaba act that way before.

 At the moment, the two of us had different impressions of Wakaba, so I couldn't be sure.
 But, after hearing about this side of Wakaba that I had no knowledge of... I didn't know if I should be happy about this, or what.
 
 Still, for some reason, I had an urge to smile.

  Have you ever invited a girl other than Sis out anywhere?」
 Other than Wakaba, eh? The only one that comes to mind―
 v04ce1543
 セロ「...Coco, I guess?」
 Just after I said that,
 st05_a03
 v05li0833
 ライト「...If that's a serious answer, this could get complicated.」
 Light remarked.
 
 v04ce1544
 セロ「You might be right that there hasn't been anyone other than Wakaba, but still, that's...」
 
 st05_a02
 v05li0834
 ライト「Ah-, man!
 Then I'll ask you straight!
 What do you think of Sis?」
 
 v04ce1545
 セロ「...What do you mean, what do I think...」
 Even if he asks it that bluntly, I still don't know how to answer.
 In addition, it's not the person herself... but her brother that is doing the asking.
 st05_a03
 v05li0835
 ライト「...You wouldn't say that you hate her, right?」
 v04ce1546
 セロ「Of course not.」
 As Light asked me that sadly, it was as if Wakaba was standing right in front of me this very moment.
 
 v05li0836
 ライト「Then, do you like her?」
 v04ce1547
 セロ「T-that's...」
  I didn't want to deny it.
 But, I still felt some sort of resistance to admitting it right now―
 face07_c05
 v07to0391
 トニー「Ah-, this is bad!
 I'm all outta smokes!」
 While I still was at a loss for words, an exclamation totally at odds with the atmosphere had come from behind my back.
 st05_a05
 v05li0837
 ライト「...W-what is it, Tonino?!」
 face07_c04
 v07to0392
 トニー「My bad, my bad. ...Right, sorry to ask you a favor all of a sudden, but could you get me some cigarettes of this same brand?」
 
 He pulled out from his pocket a packet of cigarettes that matched the one decorating his hat. There were still a few inside it. 
 
 st05_a02
 v05li0838
 ライト「Aren't there still some inside?」
 face07_c02
 v07to0393
 トニー「If they run out, Silvia's gonna make a fuss again.」
 st05_a03
 v05li0839
 ライト「That doesn't mean you have to get it right now...」
 face07_c04
 v07to0394
 トニー「Don't worry, don't worry, I'll give you a tip. 
 You can use the change from the cigarettes to buy something you like... how about that?」
 Tonino dropped a few coins into Light's palm, and pointed inside the inn.
 st05_a05
 v05li0840
 ライト「What? If they sell them inside the inn, then you can just...」
 face07_c09
 v07to0395
 トニー「Hmph, I can't do that. Were I to carelessly chat with the lady manager, it'd be trouble if she were to fall in love with me... ain't that right?」
 
 st05_a02
 v05li0841
 ライト「...How could that even happen. Damn...」
 Light muttered as he sorted out the coins and headed into the inn.
 
 After watching Light leave, Tonino came and sat on the seat where Light had been.
 
 st07_d00
 v04ce1548
 セロ「Er, Mr. Tonino. Did you hear what we were talking about just now, and that's why you...」
 st07_d04
 v07to0396
 トニー「...Hm? Were you guys talking?」
 He feigned ignorance while pulling out a cigarette and lighting it up―
 
 st07_d01
 v07to0397
 トニー「...Hm-, it's nice to have a smoke once in a while,」
  he said, grinning.
 v04ce1549
 セロ「You don't smoke regularly?」
 st07_d02
 v07to0398
 トニー「Nah, these are mostly for Silvia.
  I just join her in a smoke once in a whi... *cough* *cough*」
 v04ce1550
 セロ「Are you okay?」
 I pounded Tonino on the back as he suddenly coughed. With tears in his eyes―
 st07_d04
 v07to0399
 トニー「...*cough*!
 Well, didn't that work out just fine?」
  he murmured.
 v04ce1551
 セロ「What are you referring to?」
 st07_d03
 v07to0400
 トニー「I think everyone has their own ways of getting along with each other, even though I don't really know what kind of relationship you're wishing for.」
 
 v04ce1552
 セロ「...Mr. Tonino.」
 Doesn't that mean you heard everything earlier?
 st07_d00
 v07to0401
 トニー「As long as the two are able to understand each other, and maintain their relationship, I don't think they need to care what other people think or say.」
 
 v04ce1553
 セロ「......」
 st07_d03
 v07to0402
 トニー「But nevertheless. First, you have to tell the other person your feelings.」
 st07_d04
 v07to0403
 トニー「―No matter how much you care about what others think, it's fruitless to do otherwise.」
 He rubbed the cigarette on the floor, and raised his head to look at the sky. 
 st07_d00
 v07to0404
 トニー「I believe the other person... is waiting for someone to tell her his true feelings too.」
 What he said felt strangely solemn, and I nodded silently.
 ...But, honestly...
 Am I able to properly express my true feelings to the other side?
 v04ce1554
 セロ「(―Wakaba...)」
 We haven't seen each other for just two days, yet I already feel lonely.
 v04ce1555

 We took the train from Chrome, arrived at Vermilion after a day and a half, and finally met up with the rest of our group.
 
 st05_a02
 v05li0714
 ライト「Sis!
 Damn you...」
 face03_a04
 v03wa1354
 ワカバ「...S-sorry, Light...」
 This time, Wakaba couldn't pretend to be beyond reproach with Light.
  She kept apologizing, her hands pressed together as if she were praying.
 On the other hand, the other welcome taking place was quite the opposite―
 st02_a10
 v02co2635
 ココ「Ce―ro―!」
 face04_a00
 v04ce1359
 セロ「Were you a good girl, Coco?」
 st02_b06
 v02co2636
 ココ「Yup, yup.」
 After walking towards Coco, Cero hugged her and lifted her up high in the air- a reunion that pleased one's heart to watch.
 face03_a07
 v03wa1355
 ワカバ「...Cero, I'm sorry. It's all because of me...」
 face04_a01
 v04ce1360
 セロ「...No, it's okay.」
 The way Cero accepted Wakaba's apology straight away showed the depth of his character.
 v00an0898
 アンジ「(―Is Cero that mature...?)」
 Or is it that he's just indifferent to those kind of matters?
 Whichever it is, at least he's not made matters more difficult― instead being a leader and dealing with the incidents that happened while we were apart.
 
 
 v00an0899
 アンジ「(―Huh?
 Still, something isn't right.)」
 Everyone should be here, but it seems like someone's missing...
 Belle, Wakaba, Coco, Cero, Light, me, and...
 v00an0900
 アンジ「...Ah!」
 st01_a00
 v01be0677
 ベル「Miss Angelina?
 What's wrong?」
 Until now, only I'd realized that two people who should have been here― Silvia and Tonino― were not.
 
 v00an0901
 アンジ「You know, those two.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0678
 ベル「...You mean Miss Silvia and Mr. Tonino?」
 I looked around restlessly, while Belle also scanned her surroundings.
  But there was no sign of either of them.
 v00an0902
 アンジ「Hey, Wakaba, do you know where those two went?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1569
 ワカバ「...Ah, Silvia and Tonino?
 If you're looking for them, they're a little busy.」
 
 v00an0903
 アンジ「Eh?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1570
 ワカバ「Don't worry, I won't let them slip away...」
 said Wakaba with a grin on her face. Seems like she's hiding something.
 v00an0904
 アンジ「...What are you planning?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1571
 ワカバ「Nothing much. You'll know soon enough.」
 After saying that, she suddenly added,
 st03_a09
 v03wa1572
 ワカバ「Ah!
 But I'm not planning anything weird, or about to meddle in other people's business, or anything that would make you angry, you know.」
 
 What a forthright way of defending herself.
 v00an0905
 アンジ「...I understand. But don't hide too much from us, okay? It'll cause misunderstandings.」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1573
 ワカバ「...Yeah. Even I don't want to start a fight with you again.」
 The quarrel at Chrome had served as a lesson for the both of us.
 v00an0906
 アンジ「(―No, if we include Belle, it would be the three of us... I guess?)」
 According to what Wakaba had said on the train, she already regarded those two as confirmed performers in the play.
 
 But, on the other hand, Tonino had yet to express his thoughts on this.
 
 st03_a05
 v03wa1574
 ワカバ「Huh?
 It's pretty rare that you let your unease show on your face.」
 v00an0907
 アンジ「...That's because since the day I've met you, unease has been my constant companion.」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1575
 ワカバ「Ugh!」
 v00an0908
 アンジ「Well, I shouldn't worry, since you're the one that has to persuade those two.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1576
 ワカバ「U―hu―hu, right, right? Just leave it to me!」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1577
 ワカバ「...Of course, I mustn't reveal my source...」
 When I'd heard moments ago that ‘Tonino has acting experience’, I was quite taken aback.
 If that's true, he'll be our greatest asset as long as he is willing to join our troupe.
 v00an0909
 アンジ「(―Still, when you say source...)」
 No matter how I think of it, the only person who would know that is Silvia.
 face04_a04
 v04ce1556
 セロ「Alright, everyone is here. ...Wait, huh? Where are Mr. Tonino and Miss Silvia?」
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa1578
 ワカバ「Ah, you don't have to worry about those two. Also, I have something important to announce!」
 face04_a05
 v04ce1557
 セロ「Eh, w-what?」
 Wakaba pushed the leader aside, just moments after our reunion, and stood in front of everybody.
 st03_a00
 v03wa1579
 ワカバ「Ahem!
 I have some good news, and some bad news. Which do you guys want to hear first?」
 
 ...What is she talking about.
 「―Tell us the bad news first.」
 「―Best to hear the good news first.」
 v00an0910
 アンジ「―Just do whatever you want.」
 The result will be the same, anyway.
 st03_a02
 v03wa1580
 ワカバ「Man, that's boring!
 I'm asking you guys to decide!」
 As Wakaba pouted her lips, Cero swiftly stepped to the front.
 face04_a01
 v04ce1558
 セロ「Then, we'll go in order. Please tell us the good news first,」
 he said, then slipped back into the group.
 v00an0911
 アンジ「(―He's right. We should have just left it to him from the start.)」
 Among our whole troupe, the only person able to handle Wakaba was Cero.
 I couldn't say whether this is a good or a bad thing, but from my perspective, they really look like a couple.
 
 black450
 v00an0912
 アンジ「(―But I wonder what the truth is?)」
 I've never gone out with anyone before, and I couldn't even imagine dating a boy.
 
 No, could it be that I'd just never thought of it before?
  I'd decided that I was bad at dealing with men, and never looked for a boyfriend because of that... maybe that was a more accurate way of putting it.
 
 v03wa1581
 If that's the case, if I can overcome my difficulty in dealing with the opposite sex―
 v00an0913
 アンジ「(―Will there be a time where I'm able to consider them candidates for love?)」
 Still...
 v05li0842
 ライト「You serious!?
 Is it the same as Moosgrun's festival...」
 Was that Light's voice I'd heard just now?
  When he had confessed to me, I hadn't rejected because I hated him.
 At that time... Ah, I remember, I just felt some sort of resistance to being quite that friendly with him.
 v00an0914
 アンジ「(―Then, how about now?)」
 I thought for a moment, but I still had no idea.
  Could it be that it's because Light was still just a kid, after all?
 v04ce1559
 セロ「Easy, Coco. We know you're happy, so you don't have to get so excited.」
 Then how about Cero, whose age was closer to mine?
  He's a kind and honest person. I do have a favorable impression of him.
 v03wa1582
 ワカバ「...I've done it!
 Now both of you have agreed!」
 Even though it was unfortunate for Wakaba, I'm just considering a ‘what if?’ scenario.
 v00an0915
 アンジ「(―What's with this feeling?)」
 It felt kind of like―
 v03wa1583
 ワカバ「...Hey, what do you think, Anne?」
 v00an0916
 アンジ「―Ah, the same as Wakaba!」
 bg17a01
 st03_a05
 v03wa1584
 ワカバ「Huh?」
 That's right, I felt about Cero the same way I did about Wakaba.
  To me, he was just a friend... or perhaps a comrade.
 v00an0917
 アンジ「(―If I think it that way, the others are...)」
 Lulu was just a dear sibling to me, and I don't really know much about Tonino―
 
 st03_a08
 v03wa1585
 ワカバ「...Hey, Anne?
 Anne, Anne, Anne?」
 v00an0918
 アンジ「What? Could you not repeat my name over and over like that? It's weird.」
 st03_a02
 v03wa1586
 ワカバ「You're the one being weird. Were you listening to what I was saying?」
 v00an0919
 アンジ「...I...」
 Now that she'd mentioned it, I didn't even know if Wakaba had been talking about this important matter or not.
 v03wa1587
 ワカバ「...You what?
 You weren't listening, were you?」
 This is bad. I didn't fully hear what she was saying earlier.
 v00an0920
 アンジ「(―I'm sorry, Wakaba...)」
 face01_a00
 v01be0679
 ベル「...There seem to be a Thanksgiving Festival tomorrow. And we're deciding whether to participate by majority vote.」
 
 A whisper came to my rescue from behind, filling in the flow of the conversation for me.
 v00an0921
 アンジ「(―Thank you, Belle.)」
 I straightened my neck as if nothing had happened, and cleared my throat.
 st03_a02
 v00an0922
 アンジ「I was just about to answer you right now. Starting with ‘I’.」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1588
 ワカバ「Hmmm. So, what's your vote?」
 v00an0923
 アンジ「...I agree.」
 Since I hadn't heard everything she'd said, I couldn't argue otherwise.
 st03_a04
 v03wa1589
 ワカバ「Yahoo, we're unanimous!
 Now everything's solved!
 What a relief!」
 v00an0924
 アンジ「Wait, you had some other news for us, didn't you?」
 Compared to the good news, this was much more important.
 v00an0925
 アンジ「―Tell us the bad news first.」
 I said that because I felt that if a shock is coming, it's better to get that over with.
 st03_a09
 v03wa1590
 ワカバ「Uwah, really?」
 ―What do you mean, ‘really?’ Aren't you the one that gave us the choice?
 st03_a03
 v03wa1591
 ワカバ「...Um, well. Actually, I've registered us to participate in an event without telling you guys...」
 
 face05_a02

 st03_a11
 v03wa1592
 ワカバ「W-what do you mean by ‘again’?
 You're saying it as if I always do that...」
 v00an0926
 アンジ「You've done it once before, at least. The theater festival.」
 st03_a12
 v03wa1593
 ワカバ「Ah, ahahaha. I guess I have, now that you mention it.」
 Now that I mention it... yeah, right.
 v00an0927
 アンジ「(―Still, it's thanks to that...)」
 That I'm able to be here with everyone right now.
 Does this mean that I should be grateful to Wakaba?
 v00an0928
 アンジ「―So? What did you enter us in this time?」
 st03_a03
 v03wa1594
 ワカバ「Well, we're going to do an event at the Thanksgiving Festival that will be held in Vermilion tomorrow.」
 
 face04_a05
 v04ce1560
 セロ「...Tomorrow?
 Thanksgiving!?」
 Cero's reaction to the announcent sounded almost like a shriek.
 v05li0844
 ライト「That's impossible, Sis!
 Why tomorrow?」
 st03_a02
 v03wa1595
 ワカバ「That's because I just found out about that by asking people on the street. It's not like I'm the one who decided the date of the festival.」
 
 ...But the one who decided to participate of her own accord was definitely Wakaba.
 face01_a06
 v01be0680

 face05_a02
 v05li0845

 st03_a06

 Everyone's incessant questions left Wakaba stammering.
  And then, Cero too―
 face04_a08
 v04ce1561

  asked.
 st03_a11

  Wakaba was heating up.

 v03wa1598
 ワカバ「―Ugh, ugh. Everyone, calm down. Like me, I'm totally calm.
 A-anyway!
 Listen to me first, it's not like I just have bad news.」
 The way she was trying to take deep breaths and feign composure didn't particularly inspire confidence.
 st03_a00

 st03_a04
 v03wa1602
 ワカバ「After participating in the Thanksgiving Festival, the food there is all-you-can-eat. Understand? All, you, can, eat!」
 
 
 As if Coco were hypnotized, she fixed her gaze upon Wakaba and nodded to everyone of her words.
 
 It also attracted Light's attention, beside her.
 face05_a00

 Light looked at Wakaba with gleaming eyes as he swallowed.

 Instead, she drew closer and started whispering into his ear.

 Even though both of them will be the same in the end, I'll choose the former.

 As they both jumped for joy, Wakaba waggled her finger.

 Can you guys still say no to that?
  We're gonna do it, right?」
 There she goes again.

  After that, she glanced at her own brother,

 ワカバ「There's all you can eat meat and juice in the buffet too,」
  and tried to seduce him likewise.

 When Belle said that, Wakaba turned her gaze to me.
  Of course, since half of us were already in agreement, arguing would be a waste of time.

 I gave up on the conflict that I had no chance of winning.

 ベル「...Yes. Since I didn't think you would refuse, Miss Angelina.」
 
 v00an0939
 アンジ「What if I had refused?」
 face01_a05
 v01be0683
 ベル「...Eh?
 Could it be that you wanted to refuse?」
 All it took to make her so surprised was a question like that. How troublesome.
 v00an0940
 アンジ「I was joking. But the amount of trust you have in me is odd.」
 face01_a04
 v01be0684
 ベル「...?
 Is that so?」
 v00an0941
 アンジ「Hmm. No matter how I see it, it's a bit...」
 She expressed her own agreement by asking what I thought. That's so like her to do.
 
 Even though I don't dislike being trusted, I wish she were more confident in making her own decisions.
 
 v00an0942
 アンジ「(―Rather than looking to me like an older sister...)」
 Yes, she should be the ‘older sister’ that I look up to.
 v00an0943
 アンジ「(―That's how it should be, but Belle...)」
 Why does she kept following my lead in her actions and words?
 ...Could it be that she's influenced by our roles in the play as Christina and the Schwester?
 
 face01_a06
 v01be0685
 ベル「Miss Angelina?
 Is there something wrong?」
 v00an0944
 アンジ「E, eh?」
 A light touch to my shoulder brought me back to my senses.
 face01_a00
 v01be0686
 ベル「Are you feeling alright?
 You just went silent all of a sudden, so everyone...」
 
 v00an0945
 アンジ「Ah, i-it's nothing, don't worry about it. By the way!」
 That's right, there's something more important!
 v00an0946
 アンジ「Wakaba!
 What was the bad news?」
 st03_a05
 v03wa1625
 ワカバ「Huh?
 The bad news?
 Ah, I already told you guys.」
 v00an0947
 アンジ「...What do you mean?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1626
 ワカバ「Me registering to participate in the Thanksgiving Festival before getting everyone's approval.」
 ...What a pain.
 v00an0948
 アンジ「So you do know you're doing something bad.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1627
 ワカバ「...Y-yeah. But that was because it's almost the deadline, since it's going to be held tomorrow.
  Tonino and Silvia should be finishing that up by now.」
 Even though it looked spontaneous at first, unexpectedly, she'd thought this through.
 v00an0949
 アンジ「What's the good news you mentioned at the start?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1628
 ワカバ「Ah, that?
 I was referring to the ‘all you can eat’ privilege at the Thanksgiving Festival.」
 v00an0950
 アンジ「...Eh?
 Is... that all?」
 st03_a05
 v03wa1629
 ワカバ「That's right, why?」
 ...And I thought she had some actual good news for us. My anticipation was fruitless.
  For Cero to be able to handle Wakaba, who always talks like this... he's really amazing.
 st03_a00
 v03wa1630
 ワカバ「At this moment, Tonino and Silvia are making the arrangements for our performance, so don't worry.」
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa1631
 ワカバ「―Ah, one more thing!
 For various reasons, we're not staying at a hotel tonight.」
 
 face05_a02
 v05li0853
 ライト「Wait, Sis!
 Are you saying we're going to sleep in the streets?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1632
 ワカバ「How could I!
 Of course not, it's just that tourists who participate in the Thanksgiving Festival are provided with meal and a place to stay by the people in this city!」
 
 st03_a03
 v03wa1633
 ワカバ「...But, since the rooms are provided by families out of kindness, we can't really insist that all of us stay together.」
 
 st03_a00
 v03wa1634
 ワカバ「Since it's basically two people in one group, we'll split up like usual―」
 The combinations of Cero and Coco, the siblings, Silvia and Tonino.
 st03_a00
 v03wa1635
 ワカバ「...And finally, this goes without saying, Anne and Belle.」
 face05_a03
 v05li0854
 ライト「That's a really mundane arrangement. Can't we change it once in a while?」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1636
 ワカバ「―Then how about I trade places with Cero?」
 face05_a01
 v05li0855
 ライト「Oh!
 Does that mean I'll be with Coco?」
 st03_a02
 v03wa1637
 ワカバ「Yes, yes... Wait, t-that's wrong!
 I-if w-we really change it like that, won't I be staying together with Cero?!」
 
 face05_a05

 I was just joking. I'll be with Cero, right? Don't worry.」

 v02co1751
 ココ「Wor―ry.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1638
 ワカバ「Ah-haha. I guess that's right, I gu-ess...」
 Wakaba didn't seem to have the energy to get mad at Light for teasing her.
 After seeing how she sent herself into a panic, something that never happened normally, Belle and I looked at each other and smiled spontaneously.
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa1639
 ワカバ「Ah, are you two smirking?
 If you are, I'm going to trade places with one of you, you know?」
 
 If Wakaba were in the same room as me, then Belle would be with Light?
  A combination like that is impossible no matter how I think of it.
 I smiled thinly while shaking my head, and just as I opened my mouth to shoot down that suggestion―
 
 face01_a02
 v00an0951a
 アンジ「...No way.」\n
 ベル「...I'd rather not.」
 At almost the same time, Belle said almost the same thing.
 st03_a06
 v03wa1640
 ワカバ「W-what's with you two. I was just joking, you know. You don't both have to refuse so reflexively...」
 
 Belle and I looked at each other once more.
  We hadn't planned it beforehand, so why did this happen?
 face01_a04
 v01be0688
 ベル「Ah, um... That was just a coincidence earlier. I'm sorry.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1641
 ワカバ「You don't have to apologize... rather, I'm the one who should. I made a bad joke, ahahaha―」
 
 v00an0952
 アンジ「(―It's a coincidence, just like Belle said, but...)」
 Somewhere inside me, it had affected me.
 face01_a06
 v01be0689
 ベル「...By the way, I have a question.」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1642
 ワカバ「Yes, what is it?」
 The two of them had already advanced to another topic, but why were my thoughts still lingering upon what happened just now?
 
 face01_a00
 v01be0690
 ベル「What are we supposed to do at that Thanksgiving Festival?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1643
 ワカバ「Ufufufufu, about that―」
 When Wakaba started explaining that, I'd missed my chance to ask Belle.
 
 black450
 Cero and Coco, Belle and I. And then, unexpectedly, she said―
 st03_a00
 v03wa1644
 ワカバ「I'll be with Silvia, while Light stays with Tonino. How's that?」
 face05_a05
 v05li0857
 ライト「...Why?」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1645
 ワカバ「Oh? You want to stay with me?」
 face05_a02
 v05li0858
 ライト「That's not what I meant, but why you and Silvia?」
 Not only Light, but the rest of us were equally curious.
 st03_a04
 v03wa1646
 ワカバ「Well, there are reasons for that. Various ones.」
 Wakaba evaded Light's question, with an expression that hinted she were hiding something.
 v05li0859
 ライト「What's with that?」
 v00an0953
 アンジ「(―Could it be that she's doing that to ensure Silvia and Tonino will join the play?)」
 I'd definitely heard something like ‘Tonino would do what Silvia tells him to do’ on the train.
 
 face05_a03
 v05li0860
 ライト「...How suspicious. Did something happen when me and Cero weren't around?」
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa1647
 ワカバ「What are you talking about?
 Are you saying girls can't hang out with each other?」
 face05_a02
 v05li0861
 ライト「I didn't say that. It's just that you two aren't like Angelina and Fa, who are naturally compatible with each other.」
 
 Belle and I?
  We looked at each other as our names were mentioned suddenly.
 st03_a06
 v03wa1648
 ワカバ「I don't know what you're talking about. How are we not compatible?」
 face05_a06
 v05li0862
 ライト「...I don't really know how to say it, but it feels natural to put Angelina and Fa together.」
 
 face05_a03
 v05li0863
 ライト「―On the other hand, Sis and Silvia... How should I say it, two people with the same personality... it seems dangerous to have you too close.」
 
 st03_a02
 v03wa1649
 ワカバ「Hmmm. Quite an interesting notion you've got there...」
 She whacked Light on the head with a ‘Ponk!’ sound.
 
 
 face05_a07
 v05li0864
 ライト「That hurts!
 I was just saying the truth...」
 st03_a11
 v03wa1650
 ワカバ「Argh―!」
 Wakaba started to chase after Light as he took off running. Coco's face glittered with excitement as she watched.
 
 v02co1752
 ココ「Chasing, game―」
  and she went after them.
 st04_a07
 v04ce1562
 セロ「...Oh, boy. Come on, you guys, stop horsing around in a place like this!」
 Cero sighed as he tried to get the situation under control.
 
 v00an0954
 アンジ「(―Everyone is so full life.)」
 I turned my gaze back to Belle, and ran what Light had said earlier through my mind. ―We're compatible, eh?
 
 As I was thinking about that, Belle―
 st01_a05
 v01be0691
 
  「...Compatible...」 murmured to herself, and glanced at me.
 v00an0955
 アンジ「Hm?」
 st01_a11
 v01be0692
 ベル「I-it's nothing.」
 She stammered as she looked away in a hurry.
  ...Her cheeks were slightly red.
 v00an0956
 アンジ「(―W-what's going on?
 What am I thinking...)」
 I just wanted to look at Belle, and ask her what was wrong, with a smile.
  I just wanted to do something like that, but why―
 v00an0957
 アンジ「(―Why did I look away from her as well?）」

 ベル「Miss Angelina, please don't get too angry at her.」
 st00_a08
 v00an1009
 アンジ「I'm not really angry. It's just, how should I say it―」
 v01be0694
 ベル「She always springs things on us, doesn't she?」
 st00_a09
 v00an1010
 アンジ「Yeah, that's right.」
 Not only had she shocked us with her sudden declaration to participate in the Thanksgiving Festival, but―
 
 st00_a08
 v00an1011
 アンジ「She'd even decided what we're going to do for it...」
 v01be0695
 ベル「Still, I don't think we would have had enough time to discuss it with everyone.」
 
 st00_a03
 v00an1012
 アンジ「...I-I guess you're right.」
 As the organizer, the event Wakaba had decided we were putting on was a puppet play.
  ...That said, it's not going to be performed by me or Coco.
 v01be0696
 ベル「Miss Angelina, do you think Cero and Wakaba will be okay?」
 They're going to use hand puppets to create a play for the children.
 
 st00_a08
 v00an1013
 アンジ「...Since she already said she'd do it, I hope they'll take it seriously. Anyway, are you feeling alright?」
 
 v01be0697
 ベル「Me?
 I'm...」
 I felt an instant of unease and glanced at her.
 st00_a09
 v00an1014
 アンジ「You don't have to force yourself. If you want, you can trade roles with Wakaba―」
 
 v01be0698
 ベル「It's okay. I can do it.」
 I've already done it once before, in the White Capital.
 v01be0699
 ベル「(―And I'll do it again.)」
 If I run away now, it might affect me for the worse during the real play.
 Also, besides that―
 v01be0700
 ベル「Um, Miss Angelina... will you be alright?」
 st00_axx
 v00an1015
 アンジ「Me?
 Of course I can. I've practiced playing at home before, after all.」
 Angelina will provide the accompaniment by playing the organ.
 If I gain experience by partnering with different opposing roles than the one we've practiced in, I feel like it would also help with our play too.
 
 v01be0701
 ベル「I'm relieved to hear that.」
 st00_a00
 v00an1016
 アンジ「...Oh? Are you worrying about me?」
 v01be0702

 st00_a03
 v00an1017
 アンジ「So you're not worried about me?」
 She looked slightly disappointed.
 v01be0703
 ベル「E-eh?
 Do you want me to worry about you?」
 I don't think she'll do anything wrong, but...
 v01be0704
 ベル「―T-then, I'll worry about you.」
 Since she'd already said it herself, I should.
 st00_a04
 v00an1018
 アンジ「Silly you. There's no need to feel obliged to me.」
 v01be0705
 ベル「Ah, um... Then, what should I do...」
 It doesn't matter to me.
 ...More importantly, I don't know what she wants me to do.
 
 st00_a00
 v00an1019
 アンジ「...Whatever is fine, as long as you follow your own will... isn't that better?」
 
 v01be0706
 ベル「Eh?」
 v00an1020
 アンジ「Don't expect me to tell you what to do. Shouldn't you do what you want to do?」
 
 v01be0707
 ベル「...Ugh.」
 Really?
 She had a point, but I still wasn't able to accept it somehow.
 
 st00_a04
 v00an1021
 アンジ「Don't let yourself be manipulated by me, and just say what you think, okay?」
 v01be0708
 ベル「T-then I'll say it. ...I'm not worried.」
 st00_a06
 v00an1022
 アンジ「Oh, I see.」
 v01be0709
 ベル「But, I'm still a little worried.」
 st00_a00
 v00an1023
 アンジ「...Are you or aren't you?」
 v01be0710
 ベル「I-it's just as I said!
 I'm not worried, but I'm still a little worried!」
 I realized I wasn't making any sense.
 
 v01be0711
 ベル「...I'm sorry. I just, wasn't thinking...」
 st00_a04
 v00an1024
 アンジ「Don't worry about it. I went a little too far in teasing you.」
 v01be0712
 ベル「...Were you teasing me?」
 st00_a03
 v00an1025
 アンジ「Eh, y-yeah. I didn't mean any ill, I just...」
 I was a little offended.
 If the children in Silberg played a prank on me, I wouldn’t get mad and would just chide them to not do it next time.
 
 Those were just little children playing around without any ill intent. As an elder sister, I only have to tell them ‘No.’
 
 But, Miss Angelina is different.
 v01be0713
 ベル「...What do you mean by ‘just’?」
 I had thought that she was a mature and dignified adult.
 So I respected her, and felt safe with her.
 But for her to suddenly behave so childishly, even I...
 
 st00_a08
 v00an1026
 アンジ「To tell you the truth, I wanted to see that troubled expression of yours, so I just...」
 v01be0714
 ベル「...So you just...」
 That was all, but I was at a loss how to reply.
 v01be0715
 ベル「I thought you were more of an adult, Miss Angelina.」
 st00_a03
 v00an1027
 アンジ「...Sorry.」
 v01be0716
 ベル「But why did you behave so childishly all of a sudden?」
 st00_a08
 v00an1028
 アンジ「...I wonder. I don't really know why myself.」
 v01be0717
 ベル「(―If she doesn't know why herself, then it's useless for me to ask her...)」
 As I thought that, I suddenly remembered a similar conversation.
 v01be0718
 ベル「(―Furthermore, she's not the only one...)」
 At a different time and place, and between different people... This same conversation had repeated itself.
 When children at the village did something that troubled me, I would ask why they had, and they would tell me that same answer.
 
 st00_a03
 v00an1029
 アンジ「...Hey, could you hear me out without getting angry?」
 v01be0719
 ベル「O-okay.」
 v00an1030
 アンジ「At first, I was complaining how she'd already decided we're to participate in the Thanksgiving Festival, right?」
 
 st00_a07
 v00an1031
 アンジ「―And then you said that ‘we didn't have time to discuss it,’ and talked about how you were worried about Wakaba, right?」
 
 ...That was true, now that she mentioned it.
 st00_a08
 v00an1032
 アンジ「...At that time, I wondered ‘why aren't you worried about me?’」
 
 v01be0720
 ベル「Eh?
 But after that, I...」
 st00_a04
 v00an1033
 アンジ「Yes, you did worry about me later on. But that was after Wakaba.」
 v01be0721
 ベル「......」
 st00_a03
 v00an1034
 アンジ「It's silly, right? You're right here talking with me, but I still felt like you were ignoring me somehow.」
 
 v01be0722
 ベル「...Miss Angelina.」
 I'm sure that the children at the village who bothered me thought the same thing.
 ―They wanted me to pay attention to them.
 I had tried to treat them all fairly, but sometimes I wasn't able to do everything they wanted from me, and they must have felt lonely because of that.
 
 At those times, those children would express it to me with their actions.
  There were children who imitated me, and there were ones who were rude to me.
 There were ones who hid from me even when we weren't playing hide and seek, and there were ones who threw a tantrum.
 
 ...Everyone had their own way of showing that they wanted my attention.
 v01be0723
 ベル「I'm sorry.」
 st00_a05
 v00an1035
 アンジ「Eh, wait.
 Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?」
 v01be0724
 ベル「I didn't know how you felt...」
 st00_a12
 v00an1036
 アンジ「It's not a big deal anyway, so forget about it.」
 v01be0725
 ベル「...I can't do that.」
 st00_a10
 v00an1037
 アンジ「T-this is just, me being selfish...」
 v01be0726
 ベル「Even if that's true!」
 As she sought to avoid my eyes, I moved to the side to stand right in front of her and gazed directly at her.
 
 I hadn't realized her loneliness, kept answering indecisively, and got irritated of my own accord.
 
 v01be0727
 ベル「(―I'm too insensitive.)」
 I'm sure she must have thought so too.
 v01be0728
 ベル「I never even thought about it that way.」
 st00_a05
 v00an1038
 アンジ「...By ‘thought about it that way’, you mean...?」
 v01be0729
 ベル「I'm sorry, I was insensitive and didn't realize.」
 st00_a09
 v00an1039
 アンジ「W-wait. Wait a second, stop!
 Please, just stop!」
 v01be0730
 ベル「O-okay.」
 See seemed pretty agitated, and wasn't acting like her usual self.
 st00_a08
 v00an1040
 アンジ「Calm down, it's a misunderstanding. It must be. ...Listen, people's feelings aren't something you can figure out so easily.」
 
 
 st00_a00
 v00an1041
 アンジ「Even if you did notice something amiss, that would just be a guess, right?」
 v01be0731
 ベル「...I suppose.」
 st00_a04
 v00an1042
 アンジ「Even I didn't understand my own feelings. ...But you figured them out, don't you think that's weird?」
 
 v01be0732
 ベル「Is that so?
 I thought that someone like me would be able to understand you.」
 st00_axx
 v00an1043
 アンジ「......」
 v01be0733
 ベル「You might resent me for saying this, but I have lived much longer than you, Miss Angelina.」
 
 v01be0734
 ベル「―In the eyes of people as they gradually grow older, I, whose appearance never changes... must seem an unnatural existence to them.」
 
 v01be0735
 ベル「When the children at the village grow up and become taller than me, I am no longer their ‘elder sister,’ but become their ‘younger sister.’」
 
 
 v01be0736
 ベル「And then, after they became adults, the process repeats again with their next generation.」
 ...It has always been this way up until now, and will continue this way forevermore.
 v01be0737
 ベル「I had lived a long time, met many children, and watched them pass me by.」
 
 v01be0738
 ベル「―That's why, I could sort of understand your feelings...」
 st00_a02
 v00an1044
 アンジ「Are you saying that because I'm similar to the people who passed you by, you're able to understand me?」
 v01be0739
 ベル「...Yes. I'm sure they also have the same feeling―」
 st00_a02
 v00an1045
 アンジ「―In the end, isn't that still just a guess?」
 v01be0740
 ベル「...Eh?」
 Angelina's low murmur caused my words to stop short.
 st00_a09
 v00an1046
 アンジ「Do you think I'm just going to pass you by?」
 v01be0741
 ベル「...I think you had already passed me by when we first met.」
 Judging from appearance, she looked much older than me.
 ...I never knew her when she was younger, so it's a bit weird to say that she ‘passed me by’, isn't it?
 
 v00an1047
 アンジ「―How can that be true!」
 v01be0742
 ベル「Miss Angelina?」
 Her sudden gaze made me confused.
  I had no idea what I had said to make her so angry.
 v00an1048
 アンジ「Don't decide that just because you're a Sister that's lived a bit longer.」
 st00_a02
 v00an1049
 アンジ「Even though I've only known you for a short while, if I can, I'd like to be together with you from now on.」
 
 st00_a03
 v00an1050
 アンジ「Well, I might run away if you come to hate me and I can't endure it, but if that doesn't happen...」
 
 Come to hate her?
 Me?
 Hate Angelina?
 v01be0743
 ベル「...E-excuse me.」
 st00_a09
 v00an1051
 アンジ「Anyway!
 Please don't put my feelings on the same level as the people who passed you by!」
 
 v01be0744
 ベル「...Y-yes. B-but...」
 Somehow I felt that we were talking about different things.
 v01be0745
 ベル「Miss Angelina, are you... misunderstanding something?」
 v00an1052
 アンジ「You're the one that's misunderstanding things.」
 As she said that, her glare at me unfazed, I started feeling as if I were the one in the wrong.
 
 v01be0746
 ベル「(―B-but, could it be...)」
 Could it be that she didn't realize herself she was trying to get my attention, and got angry because I pointed that out...?
 
 st00_a02
 v00an1053
 アンジ「Alright, listen really carefully.」
 st00_a09
 v00an1054
 アンジ「I'm going to prove myself the person most worthy to be by your side, and I'm going to do that at the Thanksgiving Festival tomorrow.」
 
 By my side?
 Most worthy?
 Prove herself?
  Why was the conversation heading at a direction I didn't understand―
 v01be0747
 ベル「...E-eh, but.」
 st00_a08
 v00an1055
 アンジ「...O-of course, you can say so if it bothers you.」
 Her expression, full of confidence, had come crumbling down in an instant.
 st00_a03
 v00an1056
 アンジ「...If you hate me, doing something like this is a waste of time for both of us, so I hope you'll tell me that now.」
 
 v01be0748
 ベル「(―I, hate Miss Angelina?)」
 That's impossible.
 If I did, then how could we be able to travel together?
 v01be0749
 ベル「It doesn't bother me at all. After all, I―」
 v01be0750
 ベル「―Like you, Miss Angelina.」
 st00_a12
 v00an1057
 アンジ「...Ah, u-um. T-thank you...」
 There's something weird about Angelina today.
  Is this the first time I've seen her with such a red face?
 st00_a10
 v00an1058
 アンジ「T-then, well, y-you know?
 Let's do our best tomorrow, okay?」

 Though I didn't know the reason, she wasn't so fired up anymore, so I'd better not risk upsetting her again.
 
 I walked together with her, heading to a shop that rented organs.

 Oh, Cero, even if you say you're going to do it you're not lifting a finger.
 
 Is he dissatisfied with anything?

 v05li0873
 ライト「Wow, Sis, this is amazing!
 It's the Extraordinary Cat Prince!」
 v03wa1687
 ワカバ「They did really well on the design of the fake mustache.」
 It's the failure of a prince from the cartoon, the pitiful character that wants to return to the castle he was chased out of, and who's always making dumb mistakes.
 
 v03wa1688
 ワカバ「Alright, Cero, who's the model this prince is based off of?」
 st04_a03

 v03wa1689
 ワカバ「Correct!」
  As expected of a history major.

 face05_a05

 ライト「Oh well, whatever. So, what happened next?」
 v03wa1692
 ワカバ「And then!
 Gasparo was thinking ‘I have to give them my blessing,’
  but he was already disowned, right?
 So he joined the wedding ceremony in disguise!」
 v03wa1693
 ワカバ「But when he was on his way there, whenever anyone asked, he would insist ‘Gasparo is not I.’」
 
 
 
 v03wa1694
 ワカバ「Just like that, even though everyone realized that he actually was Gasparo, since he was there to give his blessing, they too feigned that he wasn't Gasparo.」
 
 v03wa1695
 ワカバ「Even when it was time to give his regards to the newlyweds, he still spoke as if he were a different person. After that, he suddenly disappeared without attracting anyone's notice.」
 
 v03wa1696
 ワカバ「From that day onwards, a tradition began that whenever someone is asked their name and they do not wish to answer, they say ‘Gasparo is not I.’」
 
 
 face05_a08

 Cat Prince used that line every now and then whenever he managed to sneak into the castle.」

 v03wa1699

 You don't trust me?」
 I'm sure I properly took over from Cero's explanation and said everything there was to say.
 face05_a02

  It's not nice to finish other people's stories for them, you know.」
 ...You've got guts, brat.

 When he suddenly looked at me with that serious expression, I was at a loss for how to answer him.
 v03wa1701
 ワカバ「Ah, sure...」
  I'm always so unusually honest when talking to Cero.
 v04ce1578

 v03wa1702
 ワカバ「Eh?」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1579
 セロ「According to a diary found in the Frescobald household, Gasparo had been welcomed back into the family on the day of the wedding ceremony.」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1580
 セロ「And from that day onwards, Gasparo took upon himself the duty to be the eldest brother's servant for as long as he had spent wandering, and finally gained the recognition of other people.」
 
 v03wa1703
 ワカバ「...That's the first time I've heard something like that.」

 ライト「Hehe, Sis, you're a complete failure.」

 That's because I'm...」
 I'm not majoring in history like Cero!
 st04_a04

 ...There he adds again.
 face05_a00
 v05li0883
 ライト「T-then?
 What more is there?!」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1583
 セロ「His elder brother, who was married to the princess was summoned by his father in law- the King- to pay his regards.」
 
 v04ce1584
 セロ「The King had heard that his son-in-law's servant was also a Frescobald, so he permitted him to raise his head when speaking to him.」
 
 st04_a02
 v04ce1585
 セロ「...But, keeping his head bowed, Gasparo said this.」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1586
 セロ「‘At present, I am not Gasparo Frescobald, but no more than my master's servant.’」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1586_2
 セロ「‘...Even though I am truly grateful for your generosity, please forgive me that.’」
 
 v03wa1705

 So Gasparo was pretty cool!)」
 That's quite a difference compared to some puppet on my hand that can only open its big mouth.
 face05_a05
 v05li0884
 ライト「...Heh, then?
 What happened next?」
 st04_a01
 v04ce1587
 セロ「The King was touched to hear that, remarked to his son-in-law that ‘you have a fine servant’, and rewarded the both of them.」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1588
 セロ「―This is a story from the Red Kingdom's official royal documents.」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1589

 st04_a08
 v04ce1590

 Even if he says that so humbly, remembering the contents of a book that he ‘happened to read’ in such detail was no mean feat.

 ワカバ「(―For someone like me, even if I wanted to remember, I'd definitely forget it by accident.)」

 Me?」

 What's with that look of suspicion and pity you're throwing me! 
 The atmosphere tells me nothing other than that you don't believe in your own elder sister.
 v03wa1708
 ワカバ「...Listen clearly. The model for the Cat Prince was a different ‘Gasparo.’」
 
 face05_a05
 v05li0889

 Gasparo had a twin?」

 v05li0890

 Light said that as he turned to the side and cupped his ear, as if trying to hear me better.
  ...I hate this attitude of his.
 v03wa1710
 ワカバ「Then how about you clean your ears before I tell you, CLEAN YOUR EARS.」
 I grabbed his ear and let him have a piece of me by shouting that into it loudly.

 I can hear you!
 You're too loud, too loud!」

 My head whipped around as I heard that familiar voice, and Belle really was there!

 v05li0893
 ライト「No, no. She's abusing me no matter how you look at it!」
 v03wa1714
 ワカバ「Of course not, this is... an ear-warming exercise!」
 I tried making up an excuse that even I wouldn't have believed.
  One look at Belle's eyes revealed that she obviously didn't buy it either.
 st01_a00
 v01be0755
 ベル「Wakaba, aren't you a good older sister?」
 v03wa1715
 ワカバ「(―Ugh, somehow she feels different from usual...)」
 Her words pressed upon me with their weight, so heavy that I couldn't say anything to retort.
 
 v03wa1716
 ワカバ「...Y-yes.」
  The most I could do is nod meekly.
 I didn't know why, but she was different from the usual Belle.

 As Light left Belle behind and ran off by himself, my shoulders slumped in defeat.

 st01_a01

 Even though I knew that was just flattery, I still felt happy to hear him praised.
 st01_a06
 v01be0758
 ベル「...And you're also a very dependable person.」
 She's looking at... not Cero, but me?
 This is weird!
 I've hardly ever heard anyone say that to me.
 
 v03wa1719
 ワカバ「That's... not true at all. I always cause trouble for others.」
 st01_a04
 v01be0759
 ベル「That's not true. When you talked with me in Chrome, I was able to make up with Miss Angelina because of you.」
 
 v03wa1720
 ワカバ「(―Ack!
 She's totally misunderstanding that!
 I just added fuel to the fire, and then left it there to burn.)」
 
 Why is she thanking me?
  Could it be that she's trying to be sarcastic?
 No, Belle would never do something like that.
  It seemed like someone had done something behind the scenes without my knowledge...
 st01_a05
 v01be0760
 ベル「...Er, Wakaba?」
 v03wa1721
 ワカバ「Huh, y-y-yes!?」
 st01_a06

 v03wa1722
 ワカバ「I-it's my pleasure to... Wait, no way! No matter what you think, Cero is much more dependable than I am.」
 
 Belle, who had been gazing at me as I said that, looked away and bowed her head.
 st01_a03
 v01be0762
 ベル「―I'm sorry.」
 v03wa1723
 ワカバ「(―How fast!)」
 Even though I was slightly hurt by her quick rejection, it's for the best.
  If her problem can be solved, I'll ask Cero what it was afterwards.
 st01_a04
 v01be0763
 ベル「It might be troublesome for you, but I still hope that you could help me.」
 v03wa1724
 ワカバ「...Eh?」

 v03wa1725
 ワカバ「Uh, kay... So, what's this about?」
 st01_a13
 v01be0765
 ベル「That's, er... could we talk about it later?」
 As she glanced towards Cero with reddened cheeks, I realized what she meant after a few seconds.
 
 v03wa1726
 ワカバ「(―So she's troubled because Cero is here!)」
 st01_a00
 v01be0766
 ベル「Then, I'll come back later. It's not nice to let Miss Angelina and Light wait for too long.」
 
 v03wa1727
 ワカバ「I understand. Don't get lost.」
 As I watched her leave, I sighed spontaneously.
 ...Hey, Belle. Is it really okay to depend on a person like me?
  Even I myself felt uneasy about my own future.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1594
 セロ「Is something troubling you too, Wakaba?」
 v03wa1728
 ワカバ「Eh, troubling me?
 Now that you mention it, um...」
 If I told Cero that I was troubled because Belle had asked me for advice, I'd look stupid and embarrass myself.
 
 st04_a01
 v04ce1595
 セロ「If I can help, do you want to discuss it with me?」
 At times like these, I really wanted to be someone that could dismiss him with a cool line like ‘...Your kindness is enough, thank you.’
 
 I heard what Angelina said at Chrome, and thought I had at least matured a little.
 
 v03wa1729
 ワカバ「―Cero, am I relying too much on you?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1596
 セロ「Of course not. I'm always relying on you too, Wakaba.」
 v03wa1730
 ワカバ「How so?
 You don't at all, do you?」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1597
 セロ「I do. Like just now, when I was explaining Gasparo from the historical point of view, I intended to let you take over the other half of the explanation.」
 
 v03wa1731
 ワカバ「...No way, isn't that just me interrupting what you wanted to say of my own accord?」
 It had been my bad habit of just saying whatever I wanted to say without thinking.
 v03wa1732
 ワカバ「Moreover, after that, you had to correct my mistakes―」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1598
 セロ「No, no, that's not what I meant!
 What I meant was explaining the creation of ‘another Gasparo’ from the real Gasparo.」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1599
 セロ「―Even though the conversation went off course during that fuss earlier, I wanted to ask you to explain the rest.」
 
 v03wa1733
 ワカバ「...Why?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1600
 セロ「That's because I'm not confident I could explain it clearly.」
 v03wa1734
 ワカバ「...Really?」
 Is he saying that just to bolster my confidence?
 st04_a00
 v04ce1601
 セロ「Light praised my knowledge, but that was just the information I happened to know offhand.」
 
 st04_a07
 v04ce1602
 セロ「Concerning the ‘Gasparo’ that was the model of the Cat Prince, I only know that he was a character in a novel.」
 
 st04_a08
 v04ce1603
 セロ「―What was the title of that novel?」
 v03wa1735
 ワカバ「...It's ‘The Red Clover’.」
 A bold work of fiction based on the history of the Red Kingdom, it was a book written nearly fifty years ago.
 
 The novel had been accepted by a wide range of audiences, as the main characters that appeared were all handsome men and beautiful ladies. It's a classic to this day.
 
 v03wa1736
 ワカバ「The Gasparo in The Red Clover was the third son of the royal family.」
 v03wa1737
 ワカバ「―He was skilled in combat and had a handsome face, but caused no end of trouble due to his mischievous personality, and was expelled from the castle.」
 
 v03wa1738
 ワカバ「...After that, whenever something happened in the castle, Prince Gasparo would disguise himself and appear as the ‘Mysterious Mustache Man’, and assist his elder brothers in many ways.」
 
 
 v03wa1739
 ワカバ「...But, whenever his disguise was seen through by the people in the castle, he would say ‘Gasparo is not I’ and leave the area.」
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce1604
 セロ「Ahh!
 So the Gasparo in the novels said that line too.」
 v03wa1740
 ワカバ「That's right. He's a dashing rogue that tries to hide his already-exposed identity, and wishes to return to the castle deep down in his heart.」 
 
 v03wa1741
 ワカバ「After they made this miserable trait of his into an animation, the cartoon ‘The Extraordinary Cat Prince’ was born.」
 
 st04_a08
 v04ce1605
 セロ「Hmm, so that's how it is.
 I've learned something new.」
 v03wa1742
 ワカバ「...Mmph, is that a sarcasm?」
 st04_a07
 v04ce1606
 セロ「No, it isn't. I really thought that... Ugh, sorry.」
 Oh, Cero, always apologizing so quickly.
  Even if it really had been sarcasm, I wouldn't seriously get angry.
 v03wa1743
 ワカバ「But this is a surprise, I didn't think you wouldn't know about ‘The Red Clover’.」
 st04_a07
 v04ce1607
 セロ「...I've tried to read it many times, but I was afraid to do so.」
 When he said that, I couldn't help but gaze at him quizzically.
 st04_a06
 v04ce1608
 セロ「Even though it's novel based on history, I heard it was rewritten heavily, so I was afraid that it would go against my values...」
 
 v03wa1744
 ワカバ「You can just accept it as entertainment.」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1609
 セロ「But that's pretty hard for me to do. Ahaha.」
 Upon discovering this side of Cero I hadn't seen before, I was briefly happy.
  ...But, that feeling passed in but an instant.
 v03wa1745
 ワカバ「(―That means, the play that we wanted to do is also...)」
 The Angel's Guidance was a historical play telling the story of how the White Kingdom met its end.
 What I have written is too a rewrite that turns the story upside down... what does Cero think of something like that?
 
 How do I, who's been manipulating history to her own liking, appear in Cero's eyes?
 
 v03wa1746
 ワカバ「H-hey... Cero...」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1610
 セロ「Hm?」
 I wanted to know what he really thought.
  But, if he thinks I'm disrespecting the past...
 v03wa1747
 ワカバ「(―Ah, this is scary...)」
 If Cero spoke ill of me, that would be the end of my confidence forever.
  I'd definitely pack my bags immediately and run away.
 v03wa1748
 ワカバ「(―Maybe not asking is for the better?)」
 But if I just carry on like this, and discover in the future that it really does offend him―
 
 There would be no mending that wound.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1611
 セロ「...Wakaba.」
 v03wa1749
 ワカバ「Ugh...」
 I wanted to ask, I knew I must ask, but I still couldn't say the words.
 v03wa1750
 ワカバ「(―Y-you know, Cero...)」
 My throat was so dry, my voice wouldn't come out.
  How am I going to tell him?
 v03wa1751
 ワカバ「...Ugh, wait, give me a minute!」
 st04_a01
 v04ce1612
 セロ「O-okay, you don't have to hurry.」
 That smile of his might crumble into disappointment with just one word. What should I do?
 
 Is there anyone that can save me from this?
  Just give me a little advice―
 v03wa1752
 ワカバ「(―Ah, I've got it!)」
 Advice!
 I'll find someone to give me advice!
  Now, who would be able to do that... maybe Angelina?
 No, even though she's dependable, sometimes she says things too harshly.
  ...In that case, since my brother and that couple are beyond consideration, the only one left is Belle.
 v03wa1753
 ワカバ「(―That's right, Belle is perfect for this. Give and take!)」
 In exchange for what she wanted to talk to me about earlier, I'll have her listen what I have to say.
 Furthermore, when I think about it, Belle is more of an older-sister type than I am.
 v03wa1754
 ワカバ「Hey, Cero... You're fine with being the Cat Prince, right?」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1613
 セロ「Eh? Are you talking about the puppet play tomorrow?」
 v03wa1755
 ワカバ「That's right!」
  As he replied, I felt a little sense of guilt.
 I'd changed the subject, since I couldn't tell him what I was thinking, but now we have to prepare for the puppet play.
 
 v03wa1756
 ワカバ「(―Think positively, and keep going straight ahead.)」
 Since I'm sure Belle will share some wisdom with me later on...

 ワカバ「We haven't said anything yet, have we?」
 v06si0578
 シルヴ「...Um, oh well, whatever.」
 It's not like in the White Capital anymore when I was on the run, so there's no need for me to leave in a hurry.
 
 ...That said, sitting around in silence with other people is quite a pain. 
 
 v06si0579
 シルヴ「...So, what is it that you two wanted to talk about?」
 face03_a03
 v03wa1762
 ワカバ「I dunno?
 I haven't heard what we were going to discuss yet.」
 st01_a03

 ベル「It's about Miss Angelina...」
 Belle looked at Wakaba with a troubled expression, and turned to look at me with that same face.
 
 v06si0580
 シルヴ「You guys don't have to mind me, just pretend I'm invisible. I mean, since this doesn't have anything to do with me.」
 
 That's why I said I wanted to leave...
 v06si0581
 シルヴ「(―Man...)」
 When the three cups of tea finally arrived, it was a good chance to make a fresh start.
 Still, when we placed our cups back on the table after one sip and waited for someone to start talking, nothing happened.
 
 v06si0582
 シルヴ「(―There's no helping it...)」
 Why am I always the one taking care of others?
 v06si0583
 シルヴ「Alright, Wakaba. Let's start with you.」
 st03_a09
 v03wa1763
 ワカバ「E-ehh?
 Why?」
 v06si0584
 シルヴ「Because if you do that, I can leave, right?」
 st03_a05
 v03wa1764
 ワカバ「Why?」
 ...Stop asking ‘why’ over and over, you're not a child anymore.
 v06si0585
 シルヴ「I wonder who was the one that called me over for the reason ‘since you're here’?」
 st03_a07

 v06si0586

 Oh, thank you for your kindness.
 st03_a06
 v03wa1767
 ワカバ「After the puppet play tomorrow, what are you two going to do?」
 
 v06si0587
 シルヴ「Us?
 ...Who knows?
 We haven't decided yet.」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1768
 ワカバ「O-kay-. Then come with us to Moosgrun, okay?」
 v06si0588
 シルヴ「...H-huh?
 Moosgrun?
 Why?」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1769
 ワカバ「There's going to be a theater festival, and we don't have enough people, so help us out. ...That's all.」
 Wakaba smiled as she said that without hesitation. Still, I don't have so much free time that I can just do everything she pleases.
 
 v06si0589
 シルヴ「...Wakaba, we're not volunteers, you know.」
 v06si0590
 シルヴ「We came all the way to Vermilion and brought Light and Coco with us just as an apology for what we did in the White Capital, you got that?」
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa1770
 ワカバ「And I'm truly grateful for that, thank you.」
 v06si0591
 シルヴ「...Ah, um. I'm glad you understand, then.」
 I wanted to complain a little more, but now that I've decided otherwise I'm at a loss. 
 
 st03_a06
 v03wa1771
 ワカバ「So, how much until you're willing to help?」
 v06si0592
 シルヴ「...Eh?」
 st03_a02
 v03wa1772
 ワカバ「I mean, how much would I need to pay you guys to help us?」
 Following the flow of this conversation, she must mean money.
 ...Even if she suddenly proposes hiring us, I couldn't make a deal without knowing what we were getting into.
 
 v06si0593
 シルヴ「First, tell me what we are going to do, and how long it will take.」
 st03_a06
 v03wa1773
 ワカバ「What I want you guys to do is help us prepare for the play, and act in it.」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1774
 ワカバ「―This would be until the theater festival ends, so about two months, I guess?」
 Due to the incident with Wakaba's draft, I've heard about her play as we were bringing Light and the others here.
 
 But they didn't go into detail, so there were still plenty of things that I wasn't clear on.
 
 v06si0594
 シルヴ「Let me ask this first, why are you asking an amateur like me?」
 v03wa1775
 ワカバ「...It's just like I said earlier, I don't have enough people. I'm recruiting people who want to participate, regardless of their experience.」
 
 v06si0595
 シルヴ「...So, what if I refuse?」
 st03_a03
 v03wa1776
 ワカバ「...If you do that, then I'll have to search for other people.」
 Her determined smile vanished, replaced by a cloudy expression that didn't suit her.
 st03_a06
 v03wa1777
 ワカバ「I was thinking of forcing you guys to join us... but I changed my mind. Since forcing people who aren't that interested won't end well.」
 
 v06si0596
 シルヴ「(―She's being unusually humble. I wonder if something happened?)」
 I was bothered by Wakaba's unusual behavior.
  Also, I'd been concerned about something else for a while―
 face01_a05
 v01be0771
 ベル「...?
 Yes, what is it?」
 v06si0597
 シルヴ「...So, why've you been staring at me all this while?」
 face01_a04
 v01be0772
 ベル「Ah, I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.」
 I didn't have to note the gleam of anticipation in her eyes to understand that she, too, was awaiting my answer.
 v06si0598
 シルヴ「(―Ahh, what should I do...)」
 How am I going to get over this habit of being unable to refuse anyone who asks my help?
 v06si0599
 シルヴ「Who's footing the bill?
 Are you going to use your allowance again?」
 face01_a00
 st03_a00
 v03wa1778
 ワカバ「Nope, I'll earn that money myself someday.」
 v06si0600
 シルヴ「Huh?
 Don't tell me you're only planning on paying us once you hit it big? Who knows how long that will take...」
 
 face01_a06
 v01be0773
 ベル「Don't worry. My father will be paying.」
 That voice from beside me surprised me a little.
 v06si0601
 シルヴ「So that means, your father is the... patron?」
 After Belle nodded slightly, Wakaba sighed a heavy sigh.
 st03_a07
 v03wa1779
 ワカバ「But, someday soon... I'll definitely pay him back.」
 v06si0602
 シルヴ「...How are you going to do that?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa1780
 ワカバ「I'll become a novelist and work hard to earn money, so don't worry.」
 v06si0603
 シルヴ「...Ahaha, you're pretty confident.」
 She was so bold it was laughable.
  ...But.
 Wakaba didn't laugh with me, or get angry.
  She just kept on gazing straight ahead of her... at her future, no doubt.
 v06si0604
 シルヴ「(―Didn't I too decide my future when I was her age?)」
 
 Even now, I still didn't have the courage to face that future.
  Somebody like me had no business laughing at Wakaba.
 v06si0605
 シルヴ「I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing. I understand your ambition.」
 In a way, she was shouldering a debt much heavier than ours.
 v06si0606
 シルヴ「―Then, could you fill me in on the details?」
 st03_a09
 v03wa1781
 ワカバ「...Eh, are you willing to accept?!」
 v06si0607
 シルヴ「I'll consider it after hearing everything.」

 ―An hour had passed.
 st03_a00
 v03wa1782
 ワカバ「...So, that's the progress we've made up to now.」
 When she finished her explanation, the sky had already gone crimson.
 v06si0608
 シルヴ「...Still, you've really surprised me. I never thought that you were...」
 Belle, who was sitting beside me, was actually Master Rein's daughter.
 st03_a05
 v03wa1783
 ワカバ「I'm surprised, too. I thought you already knew.」
 v06si0609
 シルヴ「Well... I think I'm clear on everything now.」
 I understood that she was a Sister cared for by the doll engineer known as a national treasure, Master Rein, and confirmed that he was their patron.
 
 Now that I knew that they had such an influential person backing them, I couldn't run away anymore even if I wanted to.
 
 v06si0610
 シルヴ「...Very well, I'll help you.」
 st03_a04
 v03wa1784
 ワカバ「Really!?
 Yahoo!」
 She must be really happy. She'd grabbed Belle's hands and kept swinging them this way and that.
 
 v06si0611
 シルヴ「Alright, alright. Don't make such a fuss.」
 Seeing how happy she was, I couldn't bear to tell her ‘...Actually, there's still a problem.’
 
 v06si0612
 シルヴ「(―Oh well, I'll just go sweet-talk Tonino...)」
 If he's willing to do it, he'll be much more helpful than me.
 I'm sure he wants to live up to the dreams he had in the past as well.
 v06si0613
 シルヴ「...Alright, enough chit-chat. Let's get to the main topic before it gets dark.」
 
 I clapped my hands and looked at them both.
 st03_a07
 v03wa1785
 ワカバ「...Ah, au...」
 face01_a06
 v01be0774

 face01_a05
 v01be0775
 ベル「No, following the order, it should be my turn...」
 v06si0614
 シルヴ「(―Aw, man...)」
 If this goes on, it'll be night before we're done.
 v06si0615
 シルヴ「C'mon, you two. We still have to talk about tomorrow, and there's someone waiting for me...」
 A chill ran down my spine.
  I hadn't intended to forget about him, he had just completely vanished from my memory somehow.
 v06si0616
 シルヴ「(―Sorry, Tonino!)」
 It's not like he'll get angry.
  He'll just crease his eyebrows a little and forgive me just like that.
 ...Still, I felt bad about it.
 v06si0617
 シルヴ「Sorry!
 I have something urgent to do!
 You two keep chatting!」
 I stood up from my seat, snatched the bill and headed for the counter.
 v03wa1787
 ワカバ「Ah, I said I would treat...」
 v06si0618
 シルヴ「I-it's fine!」
 I don't have time to go back to my seat. I started running to where Tonino was.
  If I can, I want to apologize to him without making any excuses.
 v06si0619
 シルヴ「(―I'm really bad at apologizing to people...)」
 ...That's the only trait of mine that's never changed. How pitiful.

 Coco placed her hands behind her back, and nodded as she walked around.
  It wasn't very different from when she'd pretended to be a police officer earlier.

 She got really happy for some reason. Raising her hands high, she stretched her back.

  As she said that, she patted her skirt, stretched out her hand to me, and opened her mouth really wide.

 st02_a02

 v07to0518
 トニー「...A grandpa who gives out candy.」
 That was the limit of my imagination.
 st02_b03
 v02co1773
 ココ「Umm. You got, it right, a bit―」
 I'm sure the part I got right was the ‘giving candy’ part.
 There's probably no one that could understand this quiz, other than Cero and Light, who are always with her.
 
 v07to0519

 v07to0520

 If that's so, isn't the answer pretty obvious already?
 ...No, if I get too confident and answer ‘the banker’, I bet I'll still be wrong.

 トニー「...The answer is ‘the banker that gives out candy,’ right?」
 st02_a07

 v02co1776
 ココ「Ah―, Via―」
 v07to0523
 トニー「...Hm?
 Oh, so she came.」
 Silvia, who was looking around from across the road, was late by exactly one hour and thirty minutes.
 
 Even though she'd left me hanging as usual again, she hadn't broken her record this time. 
 She'd probably gotten caught by Wakaba... or something.
 v07to0524
 トニー「Sorry, but could you go get her?」
 st02_b06
 v02co1777
 ココ「Kay―」
 As Coco ran off, Silvia started running towards us as well.
 She snatched up the Schwester into her arms on the way, and walked towards me, visibly in a bad mood.
 
 
 
 v07to0525

 st06_a07

 シルヴ「...I-I'm... back...」
 v07to0526
 トニー「You're out of breath from just that one little sprint?」
 st06_a02

 シルヴ「Wha!?
 I ran all... the way here!」
 Silvia placed Coco down and tried to calm her breathing, as sweat poured down her.

 st06_a02

 シルヴ「Idiot, if I smoke now, won't I have even more trouble breathing?」
 She's glaring at me. I guess I'll just give her a moment.

 When she'd finally stopped panting,
 st06_a00

  she declared.

 トニー「...So, how are the preparations?」
 st06_a04
 v06si0625
 シルヴ「Wakaba said she'll ‘overcome all the remaining issues with her willpower’.」
 How in-character for that kid.
 v07to0529
 トニー「So that means we'll be advertising the puppet play and cleaning up, eh.」
 Since I'm better with my mouth than with my hands, that's easy for me.
 I'd like to just stand behind the scenes and watch the show between doing those.
 st06_a03
 v06si0626
 シルヴ「...Well, doing that tomorrow is fine. But after that, um...」
 v07to0530
 トニー「(―Hm, is she hesitating?)」
 Silvia was always straightforward with whatever she wanted to say, and rarely kept anything to herself.
 
 When she starts to hesitate, it's usually because she made some kind of mistake and can't bring herself to admit it to me.
 
 Who knows what she's hiding or wanting to ask me this time? If I let it go on, it might get worse.
 
 v07to0531
 トニー「(―Just now, she had said ‘after that,’ so...)」
 I mustn't just act carelessly and continue our conversation pretending that I hadn't heard it.
 v07to0532
 トニー「By the way, we've got lodging for tonight, but what about tomorrow?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0627
 シルヴ「It seems they're letting us stay another night for the Thanksgiving Festival, so we'll leave the city the day after tomorrow.」

 st06_a03
 v06si0628
 シルヴ「...W-well, about that...」
 Silvia's eyes traveled from my toes to my head, as if she were sizing me up.
 
 st06_a07
 And then she turned to look at Coco, and finally sighed.
 v07to0534
 トニー「What's wrong, what's wrong?

 st06_a04
 v06si0629

 トニー「Could it be that I'm unusually handsome today, so you can't look me in the eye without blushing?」
 st06_a02
 v06si0630
 シルヴ「Idiot, you still look the same as always.」
 face02_a00
 st06_a02
 v07to0536
 トニー「...What? The least you could do is humor me a little.」
 Though if she really said that, it would only make me worry more.
 st06_a03
 v06si0631
 シルヴ「...Then, could you... do me a favor?」
 She always orders me around, saying ‘do this, do that’, so why is she asking me to do her a favor in a timid voice I can hardly hear?
 
 If I don't catch every word, I bet I'll regret it later.
 v07to0537
 トニー「What kind of favor?」
 st06_a06
 v06si0632
 シルヴ「I want you to help Wakaba and the others along with me.」
 v07to0538
 トニー「...Help? We're doing that already, aren't we?」
 st06_a02
 v06si0633
 シルヴ「That's not what I meant, I meant for a little longer after this.」
 v07to0539
 トニー「...I don't mind. Are they planning on going on tour if the puppet play for the Thanksgiving Festival is a hit?」
 
 st06_a03
 v06si0634
 シルヴ「...You're not far from the right answer, I guess.」
 I was just joking around. I never intended to guess right.
 
 But, taking a puppet play they've never done before that far is a bit...
 v07to0540
 トニー「(―Wait.)」
 Silvia had said that she wanted me to help Wakaba and the others.
 And I remembered the boy had said that the thing Wakaba thought she'd left in the White Capital was some kind of script...
 
 v07to0541
 トニー「Hey, Silvia. Do you mean... just asking...」
 v07to0542
 トニー「―Does that ‘favor’ have something to do with the script Wakaba wrote?」
 
 face02_a06
 st06_a06
 v06si0635
 シルヴ「...Yeah. They're going to participate in the theater festival in Moosgrun using that script.」
 
 ...Ah, Moosgrun's theater festival, eh? I'd heard about that from my brother.
 I could already predict that favor wouldn't just be me helping out backstage.
 
 v07to0543
 トニー「...Well, isn't that fine.」
 If I argue right now, it'd just be rude.
 I'll just pretend not to know anything as I get involved, and play along with them at my leisure.
 
 st06_a05
 v06si0636
 シルヴ「...You're willing to accept?」
 v07to0544
 トニー「Yeah. You'll still help out even if I say no, right?」

 v06si0637
 シルヴ「Y-yeah.」
 v07to0545
 トニー「Then I don't have anything more to say. Also―」
 v07to0546
 トニー「If Wakaba's trying to do something, the more people watching out for her the better, right?」
 
 st06_a04

 I tried to imitate what she was doing, but nothing happened.
  ...Is it because it's an imitation, so it won't work?
 face06_a04

 シルヴ「It didn't work just now because you're still wearing your gloves.」

 シルヴ「It reawoke them. Coco's ancient memories that were slumbering deep within her.」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1626
 セロ「Coco's ancient memories?」
 Cero looked at me, his eyes wide.
  Is this a staring contest?
 face06_a02
 v06si0651
 シルヴ「―Listen clearly, okay?
 I'll explain it to you in order.」
 st04_a02
 face06_a06
 v06si0652
 シルヴ「Judging from the type and characteristics of the Drops Coco has in the bottle upon her chest, I estimate that she's a Sister created during the golden age of the industry.」
 
 
 
 
 
 face06_a02
 v06si0653
 シルヴ「―But at that time, there are no records of any engineers who created a design placing the Drops, the ‘source of life,’ outside of a Sister's body.」
 
 
 
 face06_a03
 v06si0654
 シルヴ「Also, engineers back then emphasized aesthetics, and would never think of making a not human-like Sister. That she was created in such an elitist era left me with questions about Coco's existence.」
 
 
 
 
 Silvia, who was saying a lot of difficult things, turned to look at me.
 face06_a06
 v06si0655
 シルヴ「Well, during this golden age, not only were doll engineering skills greatly treasured, there was a tradition of not disseminating them beyond one's apprentices. As a result, those skills might not have survived to this day.」
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce1627
 セロ「So was Coco created... by some secret laboratory or something?」
 face06_a02
 v06si0656
 シルヴ「That's possible. But, at that time, creating one Sister that can move like this required a large sum of money. So it would be impossible for someone other than a wealthy person or an eccentric engineer to create her.」
 
 
 
 
 v02co1794
 ココ「Someone, wealthy?」
 face06_a06
 v06si0657
 シルヴ「Right. But it's not just about money. Back when doll engineering skills weren't widespread, if one wanted to create a Sister like her one would need an extraordinary doll engineer. ...That's why Master Rein is so crucial.」
 
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce1628
 セロ「The ‘Rein’ you mentioned just now was...」
 Rein?
 They're talking about Grampa, right?
 v06si0658
 シルヴ「Yeah, Rein Helmer, your patron. I heard about that in the inn at Chrome.」
 
 st04_a07
 v04ce1629
 セロ「We didn't intend to hide it from you, it's just we never had the chance to say it.」
 face06_a04
 v06si0659
 シルヴ「...Ah, don't worry about it. Still, I never dreamed that you guys were backed by Master Rein. It makes me kind of nervous.」
 
 
 Silvia said as she slapped her own forehead.
  Maybe... that she likes getting slapped?
 v02co1795
 ココ「Ehehe, slap, slap.」
 face06_a11
 v06si0660
 シルヴ「...Why are you slapping me on the butt?」
 v02co1796
 ココ「Because, I can't, reach―」
  Even if I stretched out my hands, I can only touch there.
 face06_a04
 v06si0661
 シルヴ「I don't get this kid at all. ...So, where was I again?」
 st04_a04
 v04ce1630
 セロ「Er, you were talking about if we wanted to create Coco or something like that, I guess?」
 Huh?
 Both of them fell silent in thought.
 face06_a00
 v06si0662
 シルヴ「Seems like I went off topic. What I meant to say was that Coco has the ability to adjust her own memory.」
 
 v06si0663
 シルヴ「Even if we humans have a past we want to forget, it's impossible to do that relying on our own willpower.」
 face06_a06
 v06si0664
 シルヴ「―The opposite would happen. If we kept telling ourselves to forget something, it just gets harder to forget.」
 face06_a02
 v06si0665
 シルヴ「But Coco is able to do it via the method I mentioned earlier.」
 Silvia is praying again.
 st04_a02
 v04ce1631
 セロ「...Please wait a moment. You mentioned ‘reawakening her ancient memories’ earlier, right?」
 face06_a06
 v06si0666
 シルヴ「Yeah, that's right. If Coco wants to forget something, and does this pose while thinking that, that memory will vanish.」
 face06_a02
 v06si0667
 シルヴ「―And then, if for some reason she does this pose again, those memories will awaken to her like a dream.」
 
 
 st04_a06
 v04ce1632
 セロ「...Coco, is that true?」
 v02co1797
 ココ「I dunno?」
 I don't really understand, but it seems like they're talking about me taking off my gloves and praying.
 face06_a06
 v06si0668
 シルヴ「Asking Coco right now is useless. Everything she remembered at that time was forgotten once I separated her hands.」
 face06_a02
 v06si0669
 シルヴ「...Right?」
 v02co1798
 ココ「Hmm?
 What is, it―?」
 Does Silvia wants to make funny faces with me this time?
 st04_a02
 v04ce1633
 セロ「...So, Miss Silvia, what did Coco remember at that time?」
 face06_a06
 v06si0670
 シルヴ「...Cero, you know about ‘Dua’, right?」
 ―Dua?
 st04_a06
 v04ce1634
 セロ「By Dua, you mean the heroine of the White Kingdom...?」
 v06si0671
 シルヴ「That's right, that Dua... Coco seems to have been acquainted with her.」
 v02co1799
 ココ「Yup, yup.」
 I remember. Dua was very strong.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1635
 セロ「...With Dua?」
 Cero's eyes are so big and round!
  Strong?
 Am I strong too?
 v02co1800
 ココ「Eheh―」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1636
 セロ「...You don't mean the Dua in a story or a picture book?」
 v02co1801
 ココ「Picture, book?
 I know―」
 Dua was very strong―
 v02co1802
 ココ「She fought, the dragon, right―?」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1637
 セロ「Huh?
 Dragon?」
 v02co1803
 ココ「...Yup. H-huh?
 She didn't, fight?」
 Which was it?
  Dua was a knight, right?
  Knights in picture books fight with dragons, right?
 But, Dua wasn't the knight in the picture book, so she didn't fight the dragon―
 st04_a04
 v04ce1638
 セロ「Miss Silvia, it seems like the Dua that Coco knows was one that appeared in a picture book...」
 v02co1804
 ココ「That's, wrong―」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1639
 セロ「...Hm?」
 I don't know how to say it, but I knew Dua.
  The Dua I knew didn't fight with the dragon.
  But, Dua was a knight, and looked very cool―
 v02co1805
 ココ「Umm, umm.」
 Why is this?
 I wasn't sure whether I knew Dua or not.

 Cero kept looking back and forth between me and Silvia.

 st04_a05
 v04ce1642
 セロ「...You mean...?」
 face06_a06
 v06si0676
 シルヴ「I mean that I could help you reobtain her ancient memories. Or the opposite, which is tuning so that something like this will never happen again. Or just give her maintenance.」
 face06_a02
 v06si0677
 シルヴ「But, if I need to remind you of it, then―」
 face06_a04
 v06si0678
 シルヴ「...I hope you'll discuss it with her before coming to a decision.」
 Silvia patted my head.
 face06_a00
 v06si0679
 シルヴ「You're more of a older brother to Coco than an owner. So discuss this with her properly.」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1643
 セロ「......Right.」
 Cero, my older brother?
 v02co1806
 ココ「(―Hmm?)」
 Is Cero, my older brother?
  I remember when Cero was still young.
  When I first met Cero, he was smaller than me―

 v00an1487
 アンジ「...Okay, stand right there.」
 Today we're practicing how to appear on stage.
 Basically, it's a dancing scene where the angel circles around Christina with playful steps.
 
 It's very important for us to position ourselves in this scene, since if we move into the deeper parts of the stage as we enter, the audience will not be able to see us.
 
 v00an1488
 アンジ「One, two, three... Stop here.」
 st01_b00
 v01be1207
 ベル「Okay.」
 v00an1489
 アンジ「Right here, you'll start circling around me clockwise.」
 st01_b06
 v01be1208
 ベル「Like... this?」
 v00an1490
 アンジ「...Yes, that's the rhythm.」
 From the right end of the stage to the left, we performed this dance a total of three times.
 It was a scene portraying the peacefulness of the White Kingdom at that moment.
 Belle was a quick learner and picked it up easily... on the other hand, I was getting left behind.
 v00an1491
 アンジ「You're going a little too fast.」
 st01_b05
 v01be1209
 ベル「Really?
 But I'm following the rhythm we set.」
 v00an1492
 アンジ「......B-but... is that so?」
 Even though I'd complained, I knew that the problem was on my side.
 I was getting out of breath, and lacked the energy to keep up.
 I couldn't help but be shocked that my pace had been the one to slowdown when we did it this time.
 
 v00an1493
 アンジ「(―Well, I can't deny that I don't get enough exercise...)」
 In addition, I had to wear a heavy dress in the real performance, if I keep this up... things would really get problematic.
 
 v00an1494
 アンジ「...Belle, let's do another ten sets.」
 st01_b08
 v01be1210
 ベル「E-eh?
 B-but that will take so long, the next group coming using the stage will get here...」
 v00an1495
 アンジ「That's simple, we'll just have to hurry it along by not resting. Come on, let's start.」
 st01_b03
 v01be1211
 ベル「B-but...」
 v00an1496
 アンジ「Yes, stop wasting time.」
 black450
 Me and Belle went to the side of the stage, and started the dance once more.
 When acting is concerned, if the pace is wrong, then everything becomes meaningless.
 It would be best to have managing the timing with a stopwatch, but right now there was nobody else here but us.
 
 I had no choice but to rely on Belle's steady rhythm and continue the practice.
 bg20b01
 v00an1497
 アンジ「......T-three times more.」
 st01_b03
 v01be1212
 ベル「Miss Angelina, I think you should rest.」
 v00an1498
 アンジ「I-I'm fine!」
 If I can't even handle something like this, then how am I qualified to stand on the stage?
 I just need to dance in a single spot. Belle has a lot more work to do than I do.
 
 v00an1499
 アンジ「(―I mustn't give up.)」
 black450
 bg20b01
 v00an1500
 アンジ「...Two more times.」
 As if I could see the goal before my eyes, it encouraged me to push myself further―
 v00an1501
 アンジ「...Eh?」
  Suddenly, something felt amiss. There was a slight difference in the spot where I was standing as we danced.
 
 The reason I could realize that was because this was the ninth time we have done this, so my body naturally remembered the whole process.
 Even though I was familiar with the dance already, there was something different about this spot.
 v00an1502
 アンジ「(―I guess I'll fix it at the destination.)」
 Situations like this might occur during the real performance, so I have to adapt to the situation and change things accordingly.
  I let Belle move to our destination before me.
  But...
 v00an1503
 アンジ「...Belle?」
 Though she was doing the right steps, the distance that she moved was shorter than planned.
 v00an1504
 アンジ「(―She's standing in the wrong spot...)」
 Belle was dangerously close to the corner of the stage, and if she starts her dancing there... Oh no!
 
 v00an1505
 アンジ「Stop!」
 st01_b05
 v01be1213
 ベル「Eh!?」
 I'm too late! ...With that thought in mind, I dived towards her―

 ベル「Kya!」
 v00an1506
 アンジ「Ouuch!」
 Even though she ended up falling on top of me in an undignified manner, at least we'd avoided the danger of falling off the stage by a hair's breadth. 
 
 st01_e08
 v01be1215
 ベル「A-are you okay?」
 v00an1507
 アンジ「...Ahahaha, I'm afraid you're much lighter than me.」
 If I'd fallen on top of her, she would definitely have been hurt.
 v00an1508
 アンジ「...Man!
 You purposely shortened the distance, didn't you?」
 st01_e03
 v01be1216
 ベル「I'm sorry, I wanted to make it a little easier for you.」
 
 v00an1509
 アンジ「You mustn't do that. You do know that if we get the points wrong, it will be dangerous, right?」
 
 st01_e05
 v01be1217
 ベル「O-okay. I'll be careful... Ah, I mustn't stay like this...」
 Belle hurried to her feet, and reached out her hand to me.
 st01_b06
 v00an1510
 アンジ「Thank you.」
 I grabbed hold of her hand, and slowly stood up.
 v00an1511
 アンジ「Ouch!」
 A sharp pain invaded my right ankle, making me frown in pain.
 
 st01_b08
 v01be1218
 ベル「Miss Angelina? Could it be that you hurt yourself just now?」
 
 v00an1512
 アンジ「It's fine, it's fine. This is nothing at all!」
 Though after balancing myself after standing up... the truth was clear.
 v00an1513
 アンジ「U-uh... Ugh...」
 The pain of putting my weight on my foot was enough to cause wrinkles on my forehead.
 v00an1514
 アンジ「Well, I'll think of something before the real performance.」
 st01_b04
 v01be1219
 ベル「...Let's go see a doctor.」
 v00an1515
 アンジ「...I guess. But first we have to clean the place up.」
 Thus, we started cleaning the place up before we left.
 st01_b03
 v01be1220
 ベル「...Miss Angelina... does it hurt?」
 v00an1516
 アンジ「Don't worry about it.」
 st01_b07
 v01be1221
 ベル「B-but... b-because of me...」
 v00an1517
 アンジ「...Dummy. Who said it was your fault?」
 st01_b13
 v01be1222
 ベル「B-but... No matter how you think about it, I'm the one who...」
 v00an1518
 アンジ「You're wrong. I'm the one at fault for asking you to overwork yourself with me.」
 Though it's meaningless to continue this argument.
 Belle was being pretty stubborn, and I can't let her think that way.
 v00an1519
 アンジ「(―She's so hopeless...)」
 I stood beside her and leaned down―

 I kissed her cheek once more, and distanced myself from her.
 Now, the problem is... how much of an injury this sprained ankle actually is.
 
 As I thought that and I prepared myself to finish up the two remaining practices...
 st01_b07
 v01be1228
 ベル「...S-sorry. But I'm... getting a little...」
 v00an1526

 She, who had been so full of energy just a while ago, was complaining that she was tired all of a sudden.

 After the checkup, Silvia had said that there wasn't anything abnormal.
 Still, she had adviced me not to force Belle to move too much.
 v00an1530
 アンジ「(―I guess I have no choice. I'll just have to practice by myself...)」
 As if I can without a partner. I guess I'll just have to do some exercise or something.

 The only one who knew, other than Belle who'd been with me at that time, was Tonino.

 Don't tell me you think I lack the willpower to do it, Lady Marion?」
 
 Thoughtlessly, I snapped at her.

 The piano that I borrowed yesterday to practice on was similar to the one at the orphanage, so that was no problem.
 
 But, the one that I'll be using at the real performance today―
 v00an1061
 アンジ「―isn't a piano, but a reed organ.」
 Since if one thinks about it, as an accompaniment to a puppet play for children,
 the soothing tone of a reed organ is much more suitable than the plinking of a piano.

 v00an1063
 アンジ「(―I guess it's passable, sort of.)」
 A reed organ won't make any sound unless you pump the bellows.
 If I got nervous and forget to do that, I'll be late in starting the performance.

 Even though she was singing, most of the soundtrack will be instrumental, playing by me.
  It was structured so that amidst Belle's narration, I'll play a number of short pieces.
 
 That's why, she won't have to feel that she's actually singing.
 
 
 v00an1065
 アンジ「(―I wonder if it's better that way?)」
 I just hope that she won't get nervous at the real performance, and can be at ease as she sings.
 Then I'll play my parts to match her singing.
 ...That would definitely be idle.
 v00an1066
 アンジ「(―This is the first real performance for the both of us, I guess.)」
 I guess it could also be called a rehearsal for our play in Moosgrun. 
 Even though we hadn't practiced for even half a day, it felt like we were quite well coordinated.
 
 What remains is to pay attention and cooperate with the pair on the other side.
 
 v00an1067
 アンジ「Wakaba, how are you guys getting along over there?」

 I turned to look at Wakaba, who was across from me, beside the stage.
 st03_a00
 v03wa1789
 ワカバ「I'm doing the final checks with Cero at the moment.」
 The ones who had to put the most work and time into this were Cero and Wakaba, who were in charge of the actual puppet play.
 Even though they can look at the script while performing, so they don't have to memorize it...
 ...they still have to speak the lines while moving the puppets at the same time.
 st03_a06

 ワカバ「Got it, Cero?
 Even if we mess up somewhere, we mustn't get nervous nor cause a fuss, and continue the play as if nothing happened.」
 
 st03_a02

 ワカバ「The most important part is our momentum. If something unexpected happens, we just have to ad-lib our way past it! You got that?」

 ‘Those little ones’ were Belle's alarm clocks dolls, Flora, Choco and Quake.

 ワカバ「Hey Belle. Those little friends of yours... can they act on stage?」

 st03_a04
 v03wa1794
 ワカバ「...I'm not talking about the theater festival.
 Just about the puppet play we're doing now.」
 When controlling the puppets below the stage, each person has two hands, thus the maximum is four puppets on stage.
 
 ...That said, Wakaba realized that she didn't have time to familiarize herself with the technique to handle a puppet on each hand, so she asked for Belle's help.

 Even though it was impressive to rewrite the script in such a short period of time―
  It was so like her to do that before she consulted Belle.

 st03_a05
 v03wa1796
 ワカバ「Hm? What are you talking about?」
 v00an1070
 アンジ「...In more ways than one.」
 Seeing how she was handling the script of the puppet play, I had mixed feelings about her being in charge of the real play's script.
 
 Though I couldn't brush off the sense of unease, I somehow still wanted to see what came of things.
 That's the feeling she gave me as a scriptwriter, for sure.
 v00an1071

 When I play my piece, that will be the signal for everybody to start.

 ワカバ「I wonder if we can really do it properly?」
 Wakaba, who was usually full of confidence, seemed to have doubts for once.
 Affected by her, I almost replied with ‘I wonder too.’
 Still, if we kept on getting uneasy like this, we won't be able to accomplish anything.
 v04ce1652
 セロ「It'll be fine. We're doing pretty well already, and even if we forget our lines during the real puppet play, we can just look back at this.」
 
 Unlike a stage play, we had a strong ally known as the ‘script’ with us as we controlled the puppets from behind the stage.
 
 Of course, if we rely too much on it, we'll lose track of our hands, so we should just think of it as a support.

 st03_a03
 v03wa1811
 ワカバ「Aren't I the one who revised this script we're using?」
 There were actually a lot of puppets in the original script of the play she'd found for the Thanksgiving Festival.
 
 But, if we had used that script just like that, we wouldn't have enough members to perform, so Wakaba rewrote most of it.
 
 st03_a06

 She's definitely right.
 I have my own special role to contribute to Wakaba's play.
 
 And that's an important task I'll have to take on when we reach our next destination ― the Red Capital.
 
 I have to inspect as many documents as I can, and obtain information about the true history of that time.

 When the volume of the organ gradually increased, by the devices of our accompanist Angelina, it signaled that it was time for me to sing.

 Even though we can't see them from where we were controlling the puppets backstage, judging from the sound of their laughter, the result wasn't bad.
 
 After running away from the castle, the Cat Prince was able to escape from the bear in the forest in one piece, and found himself beside a river bank.
 
 Now is the scene where he will meet the fairy of the lake.
 v03wa1838
 ワカバ「(―From now onwards is the part of the story that I rewrote the most.)」
 I took a deep breath, and looked towards Cero.

 Cero stayed as he was while I exchanged my bear puppet for a fairy, then raised the pitch of my voice to complete the transformation!

 The way how he would bring out the word ‘presents’ even if nobody said such a thing was in accordance to the prince's personality in the original script.

 The prince requested of the fairy.

 He said, and just as the prince was walking to the other end to hide―

 v03wa1845
 ワカバ「(―T-this set is a little too narrow.)」
 This was my fault, since I hadn't thought to switch places with Cero when I changed puppets from the bear to the fairy.
 
 Since Cero and I were crossing our arms to perform, we got closer to each other as the Prince was walking to the other end of the stage.
 
 v03wa1846
 ワカバ「...Ah, Cero... You can't go any further than this.」
 v04ce1696

  Still, the show must go on... and before I realized it,
 sv021c

 Thanks to the prince getting closer to the fairy, my distance with Cero grew more comfortable.

  ...Hm, no wonder the door guard saw through me.」
 v03wa1852

 Following the flow of the conversation, I could use the line ‘No, it's because you were wearing a crown’ next, which would then be followed by Cero's ad-lib.
 
 But, we'd forgotten that new characters would appear after this scene.

 I wanted him to keep a distance, both from the bushes on stage and from me backstage.

 Cero's face was almost touching mine. My mind went blank because of it.
 I mustn't think too much about it, I mustn't... Even though I kept telling that to myself, my heart was racing so much I couldn't stop stammering.

 There's only one last part where I needed to slap the tambourine, after that, I can just take it easy and watch the puppet play.
 
 To join the Princess's entourage, the Cat Prince had asked the fairy for help, but that had failed.
 
 With no other choice, the Cat Prince had secretly followed behind the Princess. The black cat Sister, Choco had joined too on the way, and there was a scene where the Cat Prince had wept.
 
 When they all started heading for the castle, Angelina played a marching tune while Belle sang along with the melody.
 
 Since it was quite a well known piece, the children sang along too... Then finally, they reached the front gate of the castle.

 My fingers slipped on the keys in the middle of the play, and I had to play an extra phrase to cover up my mistake.
 
 st01_a00
 v01be0813
 ベル「By the way Miss Angelina. You played the wrong note once earlier, didn't you?」
 v00an1106
 アンジ「...Ah, did you notice?」
 st01_a04
 v01be0814
 ベル「Yes, since there was an extra phrase that you didn't play during our practice.」
 st01_a06
 v01be0815
 ベル「But, you could still continue playing as if nothing had happened... That's really amazing.」
 v00an1107
 アンジ「Well, that's the most I could do.」
 Not only had I been found out by Belle, she went on to praise me for some reason. In my embarrassment, I was at a loss how to reply.
 
 st01_a03
 v01be0816
 ベル「I don't think I'd be able to react to that situation, and would be scared stiff... just like Wakaba at that time.」
 
 v00an1108
 アンジ「...At that time?」
 st01_a06
 v01be0817
 ベル「In the middle of the puppet play. The time when Cero pushed Wakaba to the side and things got all muddled up.」
 
 v00an1109
 アンジ「Oh, that's what you mean.」
 I remembered how they'd forgotten to switch positions before the scene Flora appeared in.
 
 Even though the situation was a little tense, it was a relief that I had somehow been able to stall for them.
 
 st01_a07
 v01be0818
 ベル「...I'm scared it might happen again.」
 v00an1110
 アンジ「Anyone would be afraid of that, but the main problem is, what we should do afterwards...」
 st01_a03
 v01be0819
 ベル「And if it's a situation we can't do anything about?」
 v00an1111
 アンジ「...Well, I want to say that won't happen, but...」
 That wouldn't solve the problem.
 st01_a06
 v01be0820
 ベル「...I still have the Drop from before.」
 
 
 v00an1112
 アンジ「Before?
 Back when you joined the choir team?」
 st01_a04
 v01be0821
 ベル「...Yes. Actually, I used it for the puppet play today.」
 v00an1113
 アンジ「Oh, you did?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0822
 ベル「I wish that I hadn't needed to use it, but...」
 The look on her face was like that of a child who had done something bad. Still, I had no intent of getting mad at her.
 
 v00an1114
 アンジ「We talked about that in the rain in Chrome, right?
 It's okay for you to use it.」
 v01be0823
 ベル「...But, it's something I must tell you, Miss Angelina...」
 v00an1115
 アンジ「It's okay, it's okay. You don't have to be so worried about it.」
 ...You're going to upset me too if you make faces like that.
 st01_a07
 v01be0824
 ベル「But, still...」
 v00an1116
 アンジ「Don't- make- me- get- mad-!」
 Of course, I wasn't really angry. I patted Belle's head.
 
 ...And then.
 st01_a08
 v01be0825
 ベル「......Ah, ah... umm...」
 Her cheeks turned red, and she started waving her hands this way and that, obviously flustered.
 v00an1117
 アンジ「...W-what's wrong?」
 st01_a11
 v01be0826
 ベル「Er, i-it's nothing... You just suddenly touched me, so I didn't know what to do...」
 
 v00an1118
 アンジ「Ah, sorry.」
 I felt bad, so I pulled my hand away, but it seemed like that wasn't enough to calm her down.
 For a moment, ‘that's an unexpectedly cute reaction’ ran through my mind, though it seems like she had been quite shocked by it.
 
 It's a little late to say this, but―
 v00an1119
 アンジ「...There's times when the kids suddenly jump onto my back, and I react a little weirdly from the shock of it... So I understand when that happens.」
 
 I still said it anyway.
 st01_a04
 v01be0827
 ベル「...I know what that's like. The children at the village do that sometimes too.」
 
 v00an1120
 アンジ「Right?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0828
 ベル「But, when you patted me it was a little different...」
 st01_a11
 v01be0829
 ベル「...How should I say it, it feels a bit embarrassing.」
 Belle waved her wing, and bowed her head shyly.
 Looking at her, I really wanted to pat her on the head again... But I somehow held back.
 
 v00an1121
 アンジ「You have to get used to this from now on, okay? If you react like that in the middle of the play, then our dialogue won't go smoothly.」
 
 st01_a08
 v01be0830
 ベル「I-it's fine. I have the Focus Drop with me, so nothing like that will happen.」
 
 
 
 v00an1122
 アンジ「...Now that you mention it, aren't you using that right now?」
 I've been with her since the puppet play ended, and haven't seen her take that Drop out.
 
 st01_a03
 v01be0831
 ベル「You're right, but...」
 v00an1123
 アンジ「Does that Drop really have that kind of effect? Could it be that you had ‘believe that it had that kind of effect’, thus it gives you confidence?」
 
 
 
 
 st01_a07
 v01be0832
 ベル「No, that's not true. If I hadn't used it, I really would have not been able to sing.」
 
 She closed her eyes and placed her hands on her chest, above the spot within which her precious Drops rest, as she said that.
 st01_a04
 v01be0833
 ベル「...A long time ago, when the children of the village demanded that I sing for them, I tried using this type of Drop to do it.」
 
 
 
 v00an1124
 アンジ「...I see.」
 st01_a00
 v01be0834
 ベル「At that time, I had never dreamed of singing for anyone else.」
 
 Belle's eyes were misty with nostalgia as she glanced towards the distant horizon.
 st01_a03
 v01be0835
 ベル「...I was... always alone.」
 st01_a07
 v01be0836
 ベル「...This is the one method that will protect me from failure.」
 She awoke me up from my reverie as she murmured that, her head slightly bowed.
 st01_a06
 v01be0837
 ベル「As you know, we Sisters are able to move because of these specials gemstones, called Drops.」
 
 
 
 
 v01be0838
 ベル「Among them, there is a kind of Drop that can temporarily increase my concentration, ensuring that I act upon the command I set for myself.」
 ...Ensuring that she acts upon the command she sets for herself?
 st01_a00
 v01be0839
 ベル「―Do you still remember that time in the White Capital where I joined the choir team?」
 v00an1125
 アンジ「Y-yeah. Of course I do.」
 It was me, after all, that had made her sing as practice.
 st01_a03
 v01be0840
 ベル「At that time, I used that special Drop to sing. And I borrowed its powers for today as well..」
 
 
 v00an1126
 アンジ「So, that's what you meant by... a method to protect you from failure?」
 st01_a07
 v01be0841
 ベル「...Yes.」
 Even though I was still curious, I didn't pursue it further.
 At least now I understood what it was that Belle had swallowed when she stood amongst that choir.
 v00an1127
 アンジ「...When you sang earlier, did you borrow the power of that Drop to sing too?」
 
 
 st01_a03
 v01be0842
 ベル「That might be so...」
 v00an1128
 アンジ「...‘That might be so,’ you say? But just now, you said that you did use the power of the Drop, right?」
 
 
 
 I understand that she was afraid of failure.
  ...But, ‘commanding’ herself to sing was different.
 v00an1129
 アンジ「In songs, there are lyrics, while in plays there are scripts.」
 v00an1130
 アンジ「Once we stand on the stage, we mustn't make any mistakes. That applies to both singing and acting.」
 v00an1131
 アンジ「It is because we do not want to fail that we must keep practicing and get closer to perfection. Don't you agree?」
 v01be0843
 ベル「...I think so too.」
 v00an1132
 アンジ「...But, you wanted to bypass that just because you're afraid of failure.」
 v00an1133
 アンジ「―Also, you know, it makes me worry.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0844
 ベル「...About?」
 I thought of the time I spent looking after her in Aubergine.
 v00an1134
 アンジ「I'm worried that something might happen to your body because of that Drop, just like it did on the train.」
 
 
 I'm sure that Drops are like human medicines, even if she takes it the right way.
 
 
 
 v00an1135
 アンジ「...If you use a Drop with powerful effects, you'll feel side effects from it afterwards, right?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0845
 ベル「...That's correct.」
 v00an1136
 アンジ「Then, I cannot agree to that.」
 Belle's health is definitely much more important than the play's success.
  There is no way I'm going to give in regarding this matter.
 st01_a07
 v01be0846
 ベル「......I understand.」
 Belle closed her eyes, sighed slightly, then turned her back to me.
  After that, in a single breath,
 v01be0847
 ベル「...Please try not to look at me,」
  she murmured.
 v01be0848
 ベル「*cough*, *cough*!」
  Suddenly, she started coughing.
 v00an1137
 アンジ「W-what's wrong?」
 st01_a04
 v01be0849
 ベル「...Ah, i-it's fine. I-I'm all right now.」
 Belle said as she turned back to me, and slowly lowered the hand that was covering her mouth.
 st01_a06
 v01be0850
 ベル「...I coughed out that Drop just now.」
 
 
 Her hand formed a fist as she hid it behind her back.
 v00an1138
 アンジ「...Ah...」
 st01_a01
 v01be0851
 ベル「I'll work hard to be able to sing and act without using this.」
 I was the one who had disagreed, so I couldn't complain about what she had done.
  It's just that, somehow... why do I feel a sense of guilt?
 v00an1139
 アンジ「......」
 In this situation, where I couldn't say anything even though I wanted to, Belle turned her eyes away and stared at the distant horizon.
 
 st01_a00
 v01be0852
 ベル「―You know, I'm only able to sing when I'm alone.」
 v00an1140
 アンジ「Eh?」
 Srhn_BGM15
 st01_a01
 v01be0853
 ベル「The first thing my father taught me was how to sing.」
 st01_a04
 v01be0854
 ベル「...When I first awoke, there were many times where I was left all alone. The notebooks full of music and lyrics, given to me by my father, were my treasures.」
 
 v00an1141
 アンジ「......」
 st01_a00
 v01be0855
 ベル「And then, suddenly, one day... Those children were beside my pillow, waking me up.」
 
 v00an1142
 アンジ「Do you mean Flora and the others?」
 st01_a06
 v01be0856
 ベル「Yes. At first, I thought Father had made them for me, but after asking Flora I realized that wasn't the case.」
 
 ...It wasn't Mr. Helmer who had made them, but somebody else?
 st01_a01
 v01be0857
 ベル「Even if it didn't have anything to do with Father... I was still happy.」
 st01_a00
 v01be0858
 ベル「I have always been singing before them.」
 v00an1143
 アンジ「So your father merely watched?」
 st01_a06
 v01be0859
 ベル「Father is busy with his job most of the time, but he does listen to me sing occasionally. At those times, he grows very happy and smiles at me.」
 
 v01be0860
 ベル「But, sometimes, he will say this to me with a melancholy expression.」
 st01_a03
 v01be0861
 ベル「...Are you happy that you were born?」
 v00an1144
 アンジ「Why did he ask something like that?」
 v01be0862
 ベル「I don't know exactly, but I do know that I was created to look exactly like another Sister I was based upon, for the sake of a certain ‘project.’」
 
 
 
 ...Another Sister she was based upon?
 
 
 st01_a07
 v01be0863
 ベル「And that Father seemed to deeply regret having been involved with that project...」
 
 st01_a04
 v01be0864
 ベル「In the past, when Father used to drink, he told me that while he was drunk.」
 
 v00an1145
 アンジ「...I see.」
 st01_a03
 v01be0865
 ベル「That's why, to Father, I might not be his daughter even though I am his daughter.」
 v00an1146
 アンジ「Why say something like that?」
 st01_a07
 v01be0866
 ベル「...Actually, to this day, Father has never called me by my own name.」
 st01_a04
 v01be0867
 ベル「―He always addresses me as ‘you’, and before others, he refers to me as ‘my daughter’.」
 ...He's never called her... by her name before.
 v00an1147
 アンジ「(―But, that goes for...)」
 st01_a03
 v01be0868
 ベル「I didn't mind at first, but after we started living in Silberg and I had the chance to interact with others in the village, I started thinking...」
 v01be0869
 ベル「...Is the reason why Father won't call me by my name that he doesn't love me?」
 
 st01_a00
 v01be0870
 ベル「...Normally, anyone's parents should call them by their own name, right?」
 I could see the turmoil inside her expressed within her eyes.
 But what should I say to her?
 v00an1148
 アンジ「(―Even if I think about it, I have no idea.)」
 I could only answer her with my own knowledge.
  If I impulsively speak to her about a situation I know nothing of, that would only hurt her.
 v00an1149
 アンジ「That's right, normally you would be called by your name.
  But, it could be that he has some reason he can't call you by your name.」
 st01_a02
 v01be0871
 ベル「......」
 v00an1150
 アンジ「But, I'm not your father, so I don't know what that reason is.」
 v00an1151
 アンジ「But, I... I'll tell you my own reason.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0872
 ベル「...Your own... reason...?」
 v00an1152
 アンジ「I've never... called you by your name either, have I?」
 Within our conversation about Rein, her father, I found the means to admit that to her.
 
 st01_a08
 v01be0873
 ベル「...Ah.」
 v00an1153
 アンジ「(―Huh?
 Did she say ‘Ah’ just now?)」
 st01_a04
 v01be0874
 ベル「Now that you mention it, I guess you haven't.」
 ...Could it be that she didn't realize all this while?
 v00an1154
 アンジ「A-anyway!
 I don't know the reason your father's never called you by your name, but for me...」
 
 st01_a06
 v01be0875
 ベル「It's because we promised, didn't we?」
 v00an1155
 アンジ「...H-huh?」
 st01_a05
 v01be0876
 ベル「Eh?
 You did said that you would call me ‘Schwester.’」
 ―I did say that, I definitely did say that.
  But, I had not once called her by her name before that, either.
 v00an1156
 アンジ「(―She doesn't mean ill, I understand that clearly.)」
 But being interrupted by her... was as if I were a balloon and she'd just poked a hole in me.
 Anyway, right now, Belle's problem is much more important than my own. I'd better return to the original topic of conversation.
 
 v00an1157
 アンジ「...Okay, forget about my problem. We'll talk about you and your father.」
 
 v00an1158
 アンジ「Do you honestly... feel that he doesn't love you?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0877
 ベル「...No. It just comes to mind occasionally and makes me uneasy, that's all.」
 
 v00an1159
 アンジ「...Ufufu.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0878
 ベル「Have I said something amusing?」
 v00an1160
 アンジ「No, it's not that... Because that's true for me as well.」
 My mother's face floated up inside my mind.
 v00an1161
 アンジ「For as long as I can remember, I was already living in the orphanage and being raised by my mother.」
 
 v00an1162
 アンジ「―When I was still a child, whenever I did something to make her angry, or whenever I asked her for something but she refused, I would feel like that.」
 
 v00an1163
 アンジ「At times like those, I would inconsiderately think ‘she doesn't love me.’ Or else something like ‘it's because I'm not her real daughter.’」
 
 st01_a03
 v01be0879
 ベル「......」
 v00an1164
 アンジ「Even if my reason is different, I've thought the same as you do.
  But, I don't feel that way anymore.」
 v00an1165
 アンジ「I've only been away from home for a few days, but I can truly feel how much love she raised me with.」
 
 And not just through the phone conversations with home, nor through my dreams.
 st01_a00
 v01be0880
 ベル「Why do you think that way?」
 v00an1166
 アンジ「Umm, I can't explain it clearly, but I think it has something to do with our relationship until now.」
 v00an1167
 アンジ「Even though we have no blood relation, I think that deep down in our hearts, we are family.」
 
 Belle's expression lightened up a little.
 st01_a04
 v01be0881
 ベル「...I understand a little too now. After I left home and started traveling, I felt lonely―」
 
 v01be0882
 ベル「When I woke up in the hotel in Aubergine, and saw that my father was there―」
 st01_a00
 v01be0883
 ベル「At that time, the first feeling that ran through me was...」
 She nodded several times as she searched her memory, then finally opened her eyes―
 st01_a01
 v01be0884
 ベル「The certainty that my father truly loved me,」
  and smiled as she said that.
 v00an1168
 アンジ「...How wonderful.」
 I patted her head before I could stop myself.
 st01_a08
 v01be0885
 ベル「Ah, au...」
 v00an1169
 アンジ「(―She's really so cute.)」
 Even though I felt bad about teasing her, I still can't get enough of her adorable reaction.
 v00an1170
 アンジ「This is for your father.」
  After saying that, just as I was about to pat her head again...
 st01_a11
 v01be0886
 ベル「Ah, au...」
 She leaned against me, her face completely red.
 st01_d11
 v00an1171
 アンジ「Eh, w-wait...」
 In order not to topple over as I supported her, I straightened up quickly...
 But her body was lighter and softer than I had expected, I used a little too much force, and―
 
 st01_d04
 v01be0887
 ベル「...Ahn!」
 v00an1172
 アンジ「...Y, yes?!」
 We both raised our voice and exclaimed something weird.
 st01_d11
 v01be0888
 ベル「U, um... I'm sorry.」
 v00an1173
 アンジ「I-it's okay, don't worry. I'm the one at fault for teasing you, after all...」
 st01_d04
 v01be0889
 ベル「That's not true. I didn't have the energy to stand all of a sudden...」
 v00an1174
 アンジ「But, why did you... call my name?」
 st01_d08
 v01be0890
 ベル「Eh?
 What do you mean?」
 v00an1175
 アンジ「Just now, you called me ‘Anne’ like my mom and Wakaba do.」
 She had always been calling me ‘Miss Angelina’, so it felt refreshing... No, more like it made my heart beat faster.
 st01_d11
 v01be0891
 ベル「...That wasn't it. I just made that sound I because I was shocked.」
 Belle moved slightly in my arms and hid her face in my chest.
 v00an1176
 アンジ「(―Ah, w-wait...)」
 Looking at her behaving like a baby, I felt at once embarrassed and happy.
 The warm heat from her forehead pressing against me permeated through my clothes and into my body.
 st01_d03
 v01be0892
 ベル「I'm sorry.」
 v00an1177
 アンジ「...It's okay.」
 My mind went blank when she said that. I couldn't understand why would she apologize.
 v00an1178
 アンジ「(―Was she... always this soft?)」
 Had she been like this when we danced beneath the moonlight before traveling to the Blue Capital?
  Or when I felt her skin as I was looking after her in Aubergine?
 v00an1179
 アンジ「(―I can't recall... but.)」
 ...Those times had not been the same as now.
 st01_d11
 v01be0893
 ベル「U, um... Miss Angelina.」
 Belle raised her head, and slowly shook it to left and right.
 v00an1180
 アンジ「...Ah, sorry!」
 After I realized that I was hugging Belle, I let go of her right away.
 
 v00an1181
 アンジ「I-I wasn't thinking of doing anything weird, okay?」
 v00an1182
 アンジ「It's just... that you felt different from before... I mean, it's nothing!」
 st01_d05
 v01be0894
 ベル「......」
 The sight of her wordlessly staring up at me pained my heart deeply.
 v01be0895
 ベル「...Why did you raise your hands?」
 v00an1183
 アンジ「...To show that I wasn't touching you anymore.」
 As I grew embarrassed from this, I took a step back and deliberately coughed. 
 st01_a11
 v00an1184
 アンジ「Ahem. ...Can you forgive me for that?」
 v01be0896
 ベル「For what?」
 v00an1185
 アンジ「...You know, for hugging you without letting go.」
 st01_a05
 v01be0897
 ベル「Was that something bad?」
 v00an1186
 アンジ「Well, it's not really that bad, how should I say it... umm.」
 No matter how I explain it, I don't think I could properly transfer what I think.
 v00an1187
 アンジ「...Anyway, you were troubled by it, right?」
 st01_a10
 v01be0898
 ベル「Not at all. It was comfortable, and it made me happy.」
 v00an1188
 アンジ「H-huh?」
 st01_a03
 v01be0899
 ベル「Did you... not like it?
 If that's the case...」
 As she shrank into herself and seemed about to step away, I wordlessly wrapped her in my arms once more.
 
 st01_d05
 v01be0900
 ベル「Miss... Angelina?」
 v00an1189
 アンジ「...Shhh.」
 I mustn't deny my feelings any longer.
  If I let this be―
 v00an1190
 アンジ「(―I will surely regret it.)」
 I remembered the words she spoke to me when we practiced for the puppet play.

 st01_a03
 v01be0733
 ベル「You might resent me for saying this, but I have lived much longer then you, Miss Angelina.」
 
 v01be0734
 ベル「―In the eyes of people as they gradually grow older, I, whose appearance never changes... must seem an unnatural existence to them.」
 
 st01_a02
 v01be0735
 ベル「When the children at the village grow up and became taller than me, I am no longer their ‘elder sister,’ but become their ‘younger sister.’」
 
 
 
 
 
 v01be0736
 ベル「And then, after they became adults, the process repeats again with their next generation.」
 
 
 ...It has always been this way up until now, and will continue this way forevermore.
 st01_a06
 v01be0737
 ベル「I had lived a long time, met many children, and watched them pass me by.」
 black450
 ...Among them, there might be some who were the same as I.
 v00an1191
 アンジ「(―Who fell in love with Belle, but gave up...)」
 Ever-changing humans, and the never-changing Sister.
 
 
 st00_a09
 v00an1046
 アンジ「Do you think I'm just going to pass you by?」
 black450
 As I recalled my words from before, I made up my mind.

 st01_d11
 v00an1192
 アンジ「...Even if you tell me to let go, I shall still hold on.」
 I slowly tightened my arms around her.
 v00an1193
 アンジ「You said to me before that you ‘liked’ me, didn't you?」
 v01be0901
 ベル「...Yes.」
 v00an1194
 アンジ「That goes for me too, I... love you.」
 This was the first time I had said those words with my true feelings.
 Even though I had said things like this in our rehearsal, that was merely acting... An empty line just for show.
 
 I had finally been able to realize and understand this feeling of mine that I had such difficulty expressing.
 v00an1195
 アンジ「If you could, please tell me your feelings once more.」
 v00an1196
 アンジ「―Do you... like me?」
 st01_d10
 v01be0902
 ベル「Yes, even though I cannot express it well, but... I truly, truly like you.」
 v00an1197
 アンジ「...Thank you.」
 The happiness that I felt from being accepted by her was so overwhelming that my body was trembling.
 
 st01_d05
 v01be0903
 ベル「Are you all right?」
 v00an1198
 アンジ「Y-yeah. I wonder if it's because I'm just too happy, I feel a little feverish.」
 st01_d11

 After she said that, she touched her forehead to the skin of my arm.
 st01_d10
 v01be0905
 ベル「...You see?」
 
 Even though she has the face of a little girl, her words were as if she was an older sister to me.
  The steady warmth transferred from her skin to mine made my thoughts stop short.

 v00an1200
 アンジ「Y-yes?」

 v01be0907
 ベル「...Do you want to go back to the room and rest?」
 The Thanksgiving Festival had just started.
 Since we had performed in the puppet play, we've earned the privilege to eat all we want. The others are probably having fun right now... but even if they are―
 
 v00an1201
 アンジ「...Yeah, let's do that.」
 ...I was already satisfied.
  Thanks to knowing Belle's feelings, and confessing mine to her, I felt like my whole world had changed.
 
 I moved to stand side by side with Belle, and clasped her hand in mine.
 st01_a05
 v01be0908
 ベル「Miss Angelina?」
 v00an1202
 アンジ「...Can't have you getting lonely before we reach our room...」
 I couldn't very well embrace her as we went back... so instead, I'll hold hands with her.
 st01_a10
 v01be0909
 ベル「Yes!」
  Belle replied energetically, and strengthened her grip.
 Our hands wrapped around each other, as if they were embracing.
 v00an1203
 アンジ「(―There's no winning against her...)」
 Belle, whose feelings for me were stronger than I could have ever hoped, would always be with me from now onwards...

 As that topic of conversation ended, I let out a sigh of relief. ...But then I realized that Belle's right hand was still curled around something.
 
 v00an1204
 アンジ「(―That's the Drop I had her cough out.)」
 
 
 In that case, I'll exchange something for that Drop she's holding.
 v00an1205
 アンジ「...Hey, is your other hand empty?」
 st01_a08
 v01be0910
 ベル「Eh, y-yes.」
 v00an1206
 アンジ「Then hold it out in front of you.」
 I took what I had in my pocket all this while and placed it on her outstretched palm.
 
 st01_a05
 v01be0911
 ベル「...This is...」
 v00an1207
 アンジ「...That's, from Chrome...」
 It was the Drop that I had bought from the shop on Silvia's recommendation.
 
 
 I hadn't been sure how to give it to her, but now I could naturally pass it to her.
 v00an1208
 アンジ「It's just something cheap and doesn't really have any special effect, b-but, if you like... please have it.」
 st01_a08
 v01be0912
 ベル「How could I!
 Even though it definitely is just a cheap Drop...」
 
 
 v00an1209
 アンジ「(―Ugh, I'm sorry it's cheap...)」
 Being reminded of that so honestly gave quite a hit to me.
 st01_a00
 v01be0913
 ベル「No matter how cheap it is, it is still something of value. I can't accept this.」
 I should have said something more clever when I handed it to her... Even though I already regret it, there was nothing I could do.
 v00an1210
 アンジ「It's fine, since I can't use it even if I keep it.」
 Then, why did you buy it? ...She didn't ask me that.
 st01_a04
 v01be0914
 ベル「Even if that's the case, why are you giving it to me?」
 v00an1211
 アンジ「...T-there's no one else I can give this to, right?」
 st01_a05
 v01be0915
 ベル「Um, how about Coco?」
 v00an1212
 アンジ「...Ah.」
 I had completely forgotten that Coco's a Sister too.
 
 
  But still, I hadn't bought this for Coco.
 v00an1213
 アンジ「H, her... well, Cero is with her, right?」
 v01be0916
 ベル「Cero... is with her?」
 v00an1214
 アンジ「And with you, there's...」
 ―Me. I barely stopped myself from saying that.
  Coco and Cero are family.
 To Belle, the person like family was not me... But Mr. Helmer.
 Just now, she had realized her bond with her father. I couldn't bear to place myself between them immediately after that.
 v00an1215
 アンジ「...I guess. Well, then... I'll give this to Coco.」
 If I force her to accept, it will surely make her feel troubled.
 st01_a01
 v01be0917
 ベル「It's a really cute Drop, so I think Coco will definitely be happy.」
 
 
 v00an1216
 アンジ「Y-yeah, I think so too.」
 As Belle smiled at me, I did the same.
  ...That's right, I must return her smile properly.
 v00an1217
 アンジ「(―I can't believe this is all my acting practice is good for...)」
 st01_a00
 v01be0918
 ベル「......?」
 
 I put the Drop back into my pocket, and sighed from the bottom of my heart.
 ...It seems there will never be a chance for me to give this to her.

 The puppet show had ended in success, and after cleaning up, everyone had split up and went wherever they wanted to go.
 
  The first to vanish were Silvia and Tonino.

 シルヴ「...I wanna take a shower and go to bed, see ya!」
 While Belle and Angelina went off somewhere together.
  I'm sure they must have gone somewhere to evaluate each others' performance or something.
 Light, and Coco who had been with him, had left for the food stalls drooling at the promise of ‘all you can eat.’

 v03wa1312
 ワカバ「...Ahaha, me too.」
 Even though we had quite a tense moment in the middle of the show, at least we were able to finish it safely.
 Needless to say, this was a milestone for me, since it's my first success at writing a script for puppet play.
 Of course, since this script was ‘enhanced’ from the script I had borrowed, I can't take all the credit for it.
 
 Still, the play that I had participated in was a success. That was enough to make me proud.
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1729
 セロ「So, what are you thinking of doing now?」
 v03wa1893
 ワカバ「Hmm, I haven't thought about it yet.」
 At first, I'd wanted to go eat until I'm near to bursting, like Light undoubtedly will.
  ...But if I do that, I'll surely regret it in the days to come.

 v03wa1896
 ワカバ「...I see, so it's because Coco is not around.」
 It's not like I'm trying to make him feel bad,
  but somehow I'd admitted something that made me feel a little lonely.
 st04_a07
 v04ce1732
 セロ「Sorry, I didn't mean to make an excuse...」
 v03wa1897
 ワカバ「(―Eh?
 Why is Cero apologizing?)」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1733
 セロ「It's just that, to me, Coco is the only family member I have left. So she's most important to me no matter what.」
 
 v03wa1898
 ワカバ「...That's natural. Even I have Light as my only family member in this trip.」
 
 Even though he pissed me off, and always causes trouble... I have to always keep my eye on him.
  ...No, it's the opposite.
 On this trip, I'm the one who has been causing trouble for my brother.
  Not just Light, the trouble I've caused Cero had been even more than that.
 v03wa1899
 ワカバ「Sorry, don't mind me. Go have fun at the festival.」
 I felt a little disgusted to myself, saying something I would never even think about.
  ...Things like that should rather stay in the stories I write.
 st04_a04
 v04ce1734
 セロ「Hmm. It makes me uneasy when you tell me to do that.」
 v03wa1900
 ワカバ「...Why?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1735
 セロ「Since I can't just leave you alone here, after all.」
 v03wa1901
 ワカバ「You're so old-fashioned. What's wrong with me being alone once in a while?」
 st04_a00
 v04ce1736
 セロ「...But you know, since we've hardly had a chance to be together, don't you think it's a waste if we split up?」
 
 v03wa1902
 ワカバ「Why?」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1737
 セロ「I said ‘I'll do whatever you do’ just now, right?」
 st04_a10
 v04ce1738
 セロ「I meant that I'll go with you wherever you want to go.」
 
 As I heard those words I had never expected, I was taken aback.
 But I couldn't say something halfheartedly like ‘Well then, let's go eat all we can!’ that might have dire consequences in the future.
 
 
 
 v03wa1903
 ワカバ「(―If that's the case, I should be honest with him once in a while...)」
 How nice it would be if I could just say ‘I want to be with you, Cero’ straight out.
 st04_a00
 v04ce1739
 セロ「You know, I want to be with you, Wakaba.」
 v03wa1904
 ワカバ「...Eh?」
 Why had Cero said the words that I'd been thinking?
 st04_a08
 v04ce1740
 セロ「Can't I?」
 v03wa1905
 ワカバ「Of course you can! I also...」
 
 I also―
 Srhn_BGM12
 v03wa1906
 ワカバ「I also want to be with you, after all.」
 I thought it would take a lot of courage to say that, but it came out quite naturally.
  Now that I'd said it, my feelings for him had deepened.
 v03wa1907
 ワカバ「Are you... troubled that I said something like that?」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1741
 セロ「Why?
 I'm the one who said that I wanted to be with you first...」
 v03wa1908
 ワカバ「This has nothing to do with who's first!」
 What I wanted to know were Cero's true feelings.
  When he said ‘I want to be with you’, was he having the same feelings as I?
 Or was it that, even if the words were the same... he meant something different than I had?
 v03wa1315
 ワカバ「Cero, are you happy being with me?」
 No, that's not what I really wanted to ask!
 st04_a00
 v04ce1326
 セロ「Well, of course. How about you, Wakaba?」
 ―But since I'm already here, I have to take a step further in our conversation.
  I'm sure if I just leave this way, I'll always be one step behind Cero.
 ...That's why I have to work hard so that I can stand by his side.
 v03wa1316
 ワカバ「I've been really happy. Thanks to you, I've gotten to experience so many things on this trip...」
 
 v03wa1317
 ワカバ「...In the White Capital, we went to the Dornstein castle that night, right?
  And at that time, I kissed you without thinking...」
 v03wa1318
 ワカバ「―And you said ‘thank you...’ do you still remember that?」
 st04_a08

 Even though I couldn't remember clearly, at that time, I was...
 st04_a11
 v04ce1329

 I was also happy when he said ‘thank you’ to me.
  But, back then, that kiss had been just my own one-sided gesture.

 ワカバ「...That's nice. If you kissed me, I too would...」

 v04ce1330
 セロ「Eh, no, um... that's...」
 st04_a11
 v04ce1331
 セロ「...W-would you be happy?」
 As Cero gazed into my eyes, my image was reflected in his pupils.
  Within his eyes, I was staring back at myself wordlessly.
 As if he were telling me that the chance is now.
 v03wa1321
 ワカバ「...Yes. That's because... I love you, Cero.」
 Now, I was convinced.
  At times like these, we must be honest with each other.
 Because if not... we'll fall out of balance.
 st04_a10
 v04ce1332
 セロ「...H-hey, if I may... Can I kiss you?」
 Cero did not ask that for my sake.
  Nor did he ask that because I invited him.
 ...He asked that because he wanted it himself. That's right.
 v03wa1909
 ワカバ「...Yes.」
 I could understand now, looking into his honest eyes.
  That to me, the person that I could trust the most outside of my family... was none other than Cero.

 セロ「...Wakaba...」
 v03wa1910
 ワカバ「Ah, but, doing it here is a little...」
 Even though we'd had our faces really close to each other during the puppet play, I still didn't want to do this in the middle of the road.
 
 Furthermore, if by some chance anyone who knew us saw―
 v03wa1911
 ワカバ「(―How dreadful...）」
 st04_a10
 v04ce1743

 Light is out with Coco.
  So is it safer at the house I'm lodging at than at Cero's?
 v03wa1913
 ワカバ「But, what if Light comes back...」
 v04ce1744

  ...Cero had said―
 v04ce1745
 セロ「―We haven't seen each other since the White Capital, so let's be together for today,」
 
  or something like that.
 I'd been really lonely before this.
  Since I had always been traveling with Cero together.
  When I'd woken up in the morning and Cero wasn't around...

 Everyone was kind to me, so I hadn't cried.
  But, when I'm alone, I can't do anything, right?
  Just like the winding key in my back, I can put it there, but I can't spin it.

 The Cat Prince is always funny, no matter where I see him.
 But when will he be able to go back into the castle?
  Since he's a prince, after all, shouldn't he be in the castle?
 The princess is in the castle too, right?

 v02co1834
 ココ「Ah―, is that, so―」
 That's why when I woke up in the morning, Cero wasn't around.
  ...But but, instead of Cero, Light was sleeping beside me.
 I was really shocked! And thought Cero had turned into a mini-Cero.
 
 v02co1835
 ココ「Huh―?」
 st04_a05
 v04ce1749
 セロ「Hm? What's wrong?」
 A long time ago, Cero was smaller than me and Light.
  I was the big sister back then.

 I raised my hands above my head, and straightened my back as I said that.

 st04_a04
 v04ce1750

 Cero spread out his fingers, and counted them one by one while folding each one down as he counted.
 v02co1838

 I was the one who taught him that way of counting.
 ...When he does that, he could count to ten!

  If it wasn't long ago, I can remember.

 Could that be the Cat Prince's name?」
 v02co1841

 Cero taught it to Light, and then Light taught it to me.

 So, it would be okay if I remember it... right?
  Granny told me, not to take off both of my gloves at the same time.
 But if I put them back on after this, it would be okay, right?

 アンジ「...You can go back to our room first. You should relax on your own once in a while, right?」
 ―she had told me that, but I felt that I still had some free time before heading back... so I strolled around the venue, taking care not to get lost.
 Some children and passers-by who had watched the puppet play came up and spoke to me, as time went by, the sky was already crimson when I realized it was getting late.
 v01be0919
 ベル「(―I wonder if I should head back.)」
 Going to fetch Flora and the others, whom I'd left in Silvia's care, and then back to the room where Angelina was waiting for me... would probably take me three hours.
 
 I guess that's enough time for me to relax on my own.
 v01be0920

 I sat in the seat across from Coco, and looked at Cero, who was by our side.

  Recognizing that as his signal to start,

 セロ「The first is... Christina Dorn,」
  Cero said slowly and clearly.
 v01be0931

 Cero nodded wordlessly and spoke the next name.
 v04ce1781

 v01be0932

 v01be0933

 セロ「Valery Jacquard.」
 v01be0934
 ベル「...He's a person that appears in The Angel's Guidance.」
 v04ce1784

 Judging from the names that he had spoken earlier, these two names are probably also connected to the play.
 But, I had no memory of these two names, so I shook my head.
 st04_a02
 face02_a04
 v04ce1785
 セロ「Well then, here's the last one... Efa.」
 After saying that, for some reason, Coco and Cero leaned their bodies forward against the table.
  Especially Coco, who was staring straight at me with eyes full of anticipation.
 v01be0935

 v04ce1786

 Coco seemed happy, as she was finally able to open her mouth and take a deep breath of air.
 v01be0936

 She might have wanted to give me a quiz to see how much understanding I had of the play... that's what I thought.
 But, he denied that straight away.
 st04_a08
 v04ce1787
 セロ「...No, it's just an inquiry of my own. I have to confirm these matters, since I'm going to have to do some serious research from now on.」
 As he said that, Cero wrote down the names he'd mentioned earlier on a piece of paper.
 st04_a00
 v04ce1788
 セロ「...Most of these people are connected to the historical play ‘The Angel's Guidance-’」
 Cero circled four names on the paper- Christina, Ein, Efa, and Valery.
 st04_a02

 v01be0937

 face02_b02

 Coco pointed to the name ‘Efa’ on the piece of paper.
 face02_a04

 ココ「I know, but you, don't know?」
  she looked at me as she asked that.
 v01be0938
 ベル「Do you mean that I don't recognize this person's name, but you do?」
 face02_a02
 v02co1870
 ココ「Yup. ...It's Fa―」
 Even though I was used to Coco calling me ‘Fa―’, why...
 
 st04_a06
 v04ce1791
 セロ「...Hey, Belle. Please listen closely to what I'm about to say.」
 v01be0939
 ベル「Okay.」
 With a serious expression, Cero wrote the word ‘Coco’ within that big circle on that paper, and slowly turned to look at me.
 v04ce1792
 セロ「According to her, it seems that she had actually met these people before.」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1793
 セロ「Even though I haven't heard everything from Coco yet, so I can't say for sure, I believe this is possible.」
 I was a bit nervous, worrying what could be so serious, but that was all it was.
  It might be unimaginable for a human to think that such a thing is possible, as it was such a long time ago, but to we Sisters―
 
 
 
 v01be0940
 ベル「Father has mentioned before that Coco is a Sister made in ancient times. ...So I think that is possible.」
 
 
 I too believed that possibility existed, just as Cero had said.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1794
 セロ「Then, should we confirm the actual date with Rein?」
 v01be0941

 face02_b01
 v02co1872

 Even when we're in the middle of a serious conversation, Cero still would never forget to take care of Coco, who is beside him.
 Watching this heartwarming scene, I recalled my conversation with Angelina earlier.

 v01be0942

 ...That must be it, following the flow of the conversation.
 But I still felt that it wasn't quite right somehow.
 face02_a01
 v02co1873
 ココ「Does, Efa, want some, too?」
 Coco was suddenly holding out a ball-shaped cookie for me― a macaroon. 
 v01be0943
 ベル「...You're giving it to me?
 Are you sure?」
 As I reached out to accept it, I suddenly realized something.
 v01be0944
 ベル「(―Huh?
 Just now...)」
 When she was holding out the cookie for me, Coco had called me ‘Efa’.
 st04_a05
 v04ce1796
 セロ「What's wrong, Belle?」
 v01be0945
 ベル「...Hey, Cero. Who is this ‘Efa’ person...?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1797
 セロ「According to what I've heard from Coco, I think it's the name of a Sister.」
 
 
 Efa is a Sister?
 
 
  Suddenly, my heart started beating faster.
 Somehow, I had understood something, but I couldn't express it in words.
 st04_a03
 v04ce1798
 セロ「This will sound very rude of me to ask, but you are Rein's daughter... right?」
 v01be0946
 ベル「Yes, that's right. But, why ask something like that?」
 Cero should know, since he had known Father for a long time.
 Furthermore, before we started travelling together, he must have heard Father refer to me as ‘my daughter.’
 st04_a07
 v04ce1799
 セロ「The Efa that Coco is talking about... could be referring to you, Belle.」
 v01be0947
 ベル「Efa... is me?」
 Cero wrote my name on the bottom of the paper, and drew an arrow line linking it to Efa, adding a question mark to it.
 
 st04_a04
 v04ce1800
 セロ「The reason for that is simple, it's that Coco has always been calling you ‘Fa―’. ...But I wonder if that's just a coincidence or a stretch.」
 
 v01be0948
 ベル「If Coco is right, then it means that I must have known Coco from that time.」
 face02_a03
 v02co1874
 ココ「Hmm, is that, so?」
 Even though I had mentioned that, inside me I knew that it was impossible.
 
 It might be possible if Father were a Sister, but he's human and if he had created me at that time, it was impossible for him to have lived this long.
 
 
 
 I was supported by the fifty years of my memories.
 v01be0949
 ベル「...Coco, do I look like Efa?」
 face02_b02
 v02co1875
 ココ「Yup, looks the, same.」
 v01be0950
 ベル「(―That must be the Sister I was modeled after.)」
 
 
 Considering what Father had said to me before, that was the most likely possibility.
  Still, I did not know the reason I had been created to look the same as Efa.
 Nor did I know the project that Father had been involved in.
  ...But.
 v01be0951
 ベル「I am most certainly... Rein Helmer's daughter, Belle.」
 At least that I could say with confidence.

 Coco was not good at talking, so it seemed like it would take quite some time.

  I listened to Coco's story while taking notes on it in the cafe at noon.
  ...But.

 v04ce1805

 As time went on, I couldn't make much progress in what she was saying.
 v04ce1806
 セロ「...Coco, listen, okay? I'm going to confirm what you said before this.」
 After confirming everything with her once more, half of what she said had vanished just like that...
 st02_a08
 v02co1881
 ココ「Hmm, is that, so?」
 There were parts where she herself was dubious the second time.
  The third time I confirmed the information, all that was left were the names of the people living in the castle.
 v04ce1807
 セロ「So, Hans was...」
 st02_a03

 When Belle finally came to meet us, Coco was even blurry about the people's names.
 bg17a03
 v04ce1808
 セロ「(―In the end, all that was left were the names in my memo... and a little information.)」
 If I start investigating with these as my clues, I might be able to discover something new.
 And that it might be useful for the play's script Wakaba is writing.
  ...But, is that really okay for me to do that?
 When Coco was willing to retrieve her own memories, should I have stopped her?
  If one were to ask why I had thought that―
 v04ce1809
 セロ「...Hey, Coco.」
 st02_a01
 v02co1883
 ココ「Whoa?」

 セロ「If you were able to remember your past memories and couldn't forget them anymore, would you be happy?」
 st02_b05
 v02co1884
 ココ「Hm―, I don't, know.」
 Seeing Coco answer me the way she used to, I calmed down a little.
  If we count what Silvia did that time as the first time, this was the second time Coco had retrieved her memories.
 The first time, Silvia said that it had just lasted a couple minutes, and the things Coco had said were very vague.
  But, now... when I'd done it, it had lasted two whole hours.
 v04ce1811
 セロ「(―If I keep on doing this, what kind of effects will it have on Coco?)」
 That was the factor that I was worried about.
 Once I wondered why she possessed the function to ‘seal her own memories’, I couldn't help but feel more uneasy...

 Silvia as the White Kingdom's heroine― Dua.
 And Tonino as...

 Furthermore, how could you make me play Ein―」

 We didn't have enough male actors to perform anyway, so that's the most I could do in this situation.

 Even though I was a little concerned about it, more importantly―
 v03wa1661

 At the moment, having actors with experience was of utmost importance.

 ココ「You know, but, you don't, know?」
 v01be1004

 After I agreed with her words, she passed the Drop in her hands to me.
 
 
 v02co1909

 v01be1005

 st02_b04
 v02co1910

 I could somehow understand what Coco was saying, due to the conversation we had had the day before.
 
 st02_b01
 v02co1911
 ココ「Yup, that's right.」
 Even if I'm a Sister modeled after Efa...
 Could I really accept this Drop, which had belonged to Efa?
 Still, somehow, I was attracted to that Drop―
 
 
 v01be1007
 ベル「...Okay, I understand.」
 I'll just hold onto it for her.
 In return, I took out another Drop from my pocket.
 
 
 v01be1008
 ベル「Yesterday, after I parted from you guys at the cafe, I went to find Silvia to retrieve my friends that I'd asked her to take care of.」
 
 v01be1009
 ベル「...And then...」
 A Drop had come out when she was tuning Flora. According to Silvia, it might be Coco's.
 
 
 
 v01be1010
 ベル「Is this your Drop? Coco.」
 
 
 st02_a00
 v02co1912
 ココ「Yup, yup. It's my, stone.」
 I wasn't clear on the reason why Flora was holding Coco's Drop.
 
 
 
 But, if this is really Coco's, then I should give it back to her.
 
 v01be1011

 I held on carefully to the Drop I had received from the exchange.
 There was a force within me, telling me not to let that Drop venture an inch away from me―
 After I put that Drop into a secret pocket behind the heel of my shoe, made by Father, I finally calmed down.
 I had no idea why I felt that way.
 But, after I did that... I felt truly calm. Why was that?

 ベル「(―Phew...)」
 As I sat in the train heading towards the Red Capital, I sighed quietly.
 I'd had this feeling ever since I departed from Vermilion.
 Usually, I wouldn't be worrying over it this much.
 v01be1013
 ベル「(―What should I do.)」
 I wanted to find someone to discuss this with, but there wasn't anyone suitable.
 Angelina, who was in front of me right now, is out of the question.
  Wakaba, who requested this of me, won't work either.
 Light and Cero were left, but I probably shouldn't discuss this with boys... not that I could count on them to help much, in any case.
 
 Now that it's come to this, the only person I could depend on... was myself.
 v01be1014
 ベル「―What should I do, I wonder?」
 The scenery outside the train window was so beautiful that it made me forget all my worries for a moment.
 But, they returned as soon as I turned to look at Angelina, who was sitting on the seat across from me.

 She was always so impulsive, I could hardly keep with her pace.
 I'd prefer if she explained where this came from first... Still, doing something like this is probably what makes her Wakaba.

 v03wa2026
 ワカバ「...If we split it up among everybody it would be too little, and I couldn't take it all myself either... So I'm giving it all to you, Belle.」
 
 She actually did explain it to me. 
 ...But, this was still something I couldn't accept.
 v01be0973

 st03_a09
 v03wa2027

 v01be0974

 st03_a03
 v03wa2028
 ワカバ「...Umm, let me be honest. We wanted to buy a present for Anne, and we decided to let you represent us all.」
 
 v01be0975
 ベル「...Why did you guys choose me for that?」
 st03_a00
 v03wa2029
 ワカバ「That's because we think you know Anne the best.」
 She said that without any hint of doubt, only ‘Isn't that a given?’ written on her face.
  How should I answer her?
 It's impossible that she knows what happened between us in Vermilion. 
 
 So I must try my best to keep calm.
 v01be0976
 ベル「...Do you really think so?」
  The moment I said that out of my mouth, I realized it was an unnatural thing to say.
 
 st03_a05
 v03wa2030
 ワカバ「Of course. Don't you feel the same way too, since you're Anne's partner?」
 I remained silent as she said that... somehow I couldn't yet acknowledge what she had said, so I averted my eyes from her.
 
 st03_a01
 v03wa2031
 ワカバ「...Anyways, that's all!
 I'll leave this to you!」
 v01be0977
 ベル「Ah, W-Wakaba!?」
 black450
 In the end, she forced this money onto me... thus resulting in my unease up to now.
 sv009b
 It's not that I was unwilling to do this myself.
 In fact, I was happy to hear her say that ‘I knew Anne the best’.
 
 But, choosing a present for her... the suddenness of this all made it very difficult.
 v01be1015
 ベル「(―Until now, if I were to give someone a gift...)」
 If it were someone's birthday, I would always bake a cake from scratch for them.
 While Father would always say to me ‘You being here is good enough’, so I never really gave him anything special.
 
 v01be1016
 ベル「(―Should I use this money to buy some ingredients and make something?)」
 If I were to make something myself, it would be something I'm used to like cakes or cookies, but there was no kitchen I could use at our destination.
 
 v01be1017
 ベル「(―I wonder what Angelina would want?)」
 In the end, I guess the gift that would make her the most happy is something that she would want herself.
 If that's the case, I should probably just go ask her. That might be for the best.
 
 As I made up my decision, I raised my voice to her in the seat across from me.

 st00_a06
 v00an1265
 アンジ「...?
 It's okay, you didn't interrupt me. I was just browsing through the pages.」

 Even though she said that, I'd lost my chance to get the words out of my mouth and had difficulty finding them again.
 
 v01be1021

 st00_a05
 v00an1266

 Do you mean like a favorite food?」

 アンジ「Hmm. I do like Caesar salad. Why do you ask?」
 v01be1023

 Why did I ask her about ‘food’?
  ...There's no way cooking is an option for me this time.
 st00_a00
 Angelina glanced at me for a moment with a questioning expression on her face, then returned back to reading the script.
 
 To continue this conversation,
 v01be1024
 ベル「Is there anything you like aside from food?」
  I asked.
 st00_axx
 v00an1268
 アンジ「...Anything?」
 v01be1025

 I'd replied out of reflex when she questioned me back, I should have narrowed it down... but now she might answer anything.
 
 st00_a03
 v00an1269
 アンジ「...Hmm, something I like. Well, right now...」
 Angelina winked a few times, and with a slightly red face.
 st00_a12
 v00an1270

  she murmured.
 Things she liked... you... that means me...

 v00an1271
 アンジ「...Isn't that what you're asking?」
 v01be1027
 ベル「N-no, that's not what I meant.」
 Even though I was happy she had replied that way, it wasn't the answer I was looking for.
 
 As I recalled what had happened the other day, I couldn't help from blushing myself. Searching for some escape from my embarrassment, I met Angelina's eyes again.
 
 But, she was just as flustered as I, hiding her face with the script as she peeked over it in her embarrassment. 
 
 st00_a08
 v00an1272
 アンジ「...Um, what did you actually want to ask?」
 v01be1028
 ベル「It's not anything really important, it's just that... I felt like asking...」
 st00_a00
 v00an1273
 アンジ「...I see, then let's turn the question around. Do you have anything you like?」
 v01be1029
 ベル「Do I?」
 Things that I like... I searched for an answer.
  But, the first thing that came to mind was―
 v01be1030
 ベル「...U, um... You won't get angry no matter what I say, right?」
 st00_a05
 v00an1274
 アンジ「Y-yeah. As long as it's not something I hate, like caterpillars...」
 v01be1031
 ベル「Eh, do you really hate caterpillars?」
 st00_a09
 v00an1275
 アンジ「...You don't have to go out of your way to confirm it. I can't even stand hearing the word.」
 Seeing her shiver just from hearing it, it seems like she really hated them.
  Even though I don't really like them either, I wouldn't react quite like that.
 st00_axx
 v00an1276
 アンジ「So, what were you trying to say just now?」
 v01be1032
 ベル「Eh?」
 v00an1277
 アンジ「I was asking you about something you liked, and before you answered, you asked if I would get angry...」
 v01be1033
 ベル「Well, because that's... you, Miss Angelina.」
 st00_a05
 v00an1278
 アンジ「......M-me?
 Why is that?」
 v01be1034
 ベル「I don't know. It's just that you asked me what I liked, and the first thing that came to mind...」
 
 As I looked at her, she immediately averted her eyes.
 st00_a10
 v00an1279
 アンジ「You don't have to cover for me by saying the same thing I did, you know.」
 v01be1035
 ベル「It's not like that, I really did think of that...」
 ...I hadn't expected that trying to say that once more would be so embarrassing.
 st00_a09
 v00an1280
 アンジ「Aah, that's enough!
 This conversation ends here, okay?」
 v01be1036
 ベル「...Okay.」
 As she said that, she fanned herself with the script as if it were a fan. She didn't seem angry, it looked more like―
 
 st00_a10
 v00an1281
 アンジ「Don't keep staring at me, it's embarrassing.」
 v01be1037
 ベル「I'm sorry.」
 st00_a08
 v00an1282
 アンジ「You don't have to apologize either, you know...」
 We both fidgeted, staring outside the window and nodding to ourselves without any reason.
 
 As our odd behavior continued, we turned our heads towards each other... and our eyes happened to meet again.
 
 st00_a00
 v00an1283
 アンジ「...Want to rehearse a little to take our mind off it?」
 v01be1038
 ベル「...S-sure.」
 We started to practice our lines quietly, so we didn't disturb anyone around us.
 Even though I still hadn't found out what Angelina would want, just by knowing that the feelings she held for me were still the same... I was very satisfied.
 
 All that remains is to pray the present that I'll buy with our money will be something that she likes.

  Actually, I really wanted to tell him ‘that's not true!’.
 I really, really wanted to tell him that.
 It's because of Cero that I was able to give it my all until now.
 If he wasn't around, a spoiled girl like me would definitely have―

 When we first entered the library, we were left speechless by the vast amount of books.

 Histories is nonfiction, but the play Wakaba is trying to create is fiction.

 Moreover, in that play, Ein won't be an evil person... With that as a premise, the rest will take a lot of creativity.
 
 Furthermore, no matter what we do, it will be hard to leave a good impression on the audience.
 
 In the worst-case scenario, we might even have tomatoes thrown at us, like what happened in Aubergine.
 
 But if I'm able to research as many documents as I can, and reflect them in the play, we can at least decrease the number of elements people will be skeptical of.
 
 ...We have to make it as close to reality as possible.
 Even if nine people out of ten criticize this work, if there's at least one people who appreciates it... that would be nice.

 Angelina's understanding of history was greater than I had expected. Previously, she had been quietly searching for books that seemed to be useful references.

 Whereas Tonino... favored quantity over quality.
 
 Still, having a strong man at times like these really does make you feel reassured.
 That's because it's likely that we'll have to deal with more and more books later on, thus more weight.

 Saying that, Tonino went to grab more books at his own discretion.
 
 To the eyes of people who have no interest in them, all books look the same, I suppose?
 
 And so, I sorted out the books that were of use from the pile that he brought me next, but―
 
 v00an0748
 アンジ「Looks like it's pretty hard to find what we want.」
 v04ce1302

 v00an0749
 アンジ「Cero, you sound pretty sure of that.」
 v04ce1303
 セロ「I guess. You can say this is what I normally do, after all.」
 After we'd gathered a number of books, I sorted them into piles and started reading through them, prioritizing the books that couldn't be taken out of the library.
 
 There were many such technical references that couldn't be borrowed. In addition, whenever someone wants to consult them, often they'll encounter other people who are still reading them.
 
 
 ev020o
 That's why, whenever I determine that the book in hand has information I was looking for, I quickly skim through it and copy it down.
 
 v04ce1304
 セロ「(―Hm?
 What book is this?)」
 Suddenly, I noticed a book that had been left beside my knee. I picked it up.
 The introduction claimed it to be a ‘dissenting’ view. Perhaps that makes it the same genre as the story Wakaba wants to write.
 
 
 ...But the contents of the book weren't really interesting, and from the first page it emphasized ‘this book is naught but falsehood.’
 
 I placed it back on the shelf below me, and turned my concentration to the next book.
 v04ce1898
 セロ「...There's quite a lot of information regarding the White Kingdom...」

 v04ce1308

 This is embarrassing, it seems like I got too caught up in reading. 
 I quickly started sorting the books and tried to make some space for her to put down the books she'd just carried here.

 ev020f

 She was right, I had just wanted to make some space quickly and pushed the books aside. It didn't solve the problem.

 The ocean near the Blue Capital had filled the air with a salty smell, but the Red Capital's waters were rivers that flowed down from lakes.
 
 Unlike the busy Blue Capital, where people would ship goods even through the city by its waterways, this place made it feel like time passed more slowly.

 アンジ「It's about time...」
 My watch indicated that it was five minutes past the time we'd promised.
  Though I don't really mind waiting...
 It's just that as the thought of ‘did something happen to Belle?’ ran through my mind, a sudden sense of unease struck me.
 
 st00_d06

 アンジ「...She's late. Could it be that she went the wrong way...」
 In this unfamiliar city, the roads all look the same to us, just like a maze.
 
 st00_d03
 v00an1287
 アンジ「...I wonder if she'll be okay.」
 If I had thought this might happen, I would have waited to meet up with her in front of the hotel, then went out together.
 
 v01be1039
 ベル「Miss Angelina―」
 st00_d05
 v00an1288
 アンジ「...Ah!」
 Across the avenue, Belle was running towards me, holding a bag in her arms.
 
 I waved towards her, and she sped up.
 Her short skirt fluttered in the wind as she ran energetically.

 v01be1040
 ベル「...Haa, ha, ha. I'm sorry for being late.」
 v00an1289
 アンジ「It's okay, you don't have to be in such a rush.」
 As I looked at her, panting for breath, all my complaints vanished without a trace.
  Had she tripped from running too fast, I would have felt really bad.
 v00an1290
 アンジ「Did you have trouble?」
 st01_a04
 v01be1041

 v00an1291
 アンジ「(―As I thought.)」
 I calmed down, realizing that it was just as I had worried.

  At the other roads?
 st01_a04
 v01be1044

 Belle hid the bag she was holding in front of her behind her back.

 ベル「Could you close your eyes for a while?」
  she said.
 v00an1294

 I closed my eyes, and heard the bag rustling.
 v00an1295
 アンジ「(―I wonder what it is?)」
 v01be1046
 ベル「Please put your hands out in front of you.」
 v00an1296
 アンジ「...Both of them?」
 I stretched out my hands apprehensively, and they came into contact with Belle's.
 
 v01be1047
 ベル「E-er, you can open up your eyes now.」
 v00an1297
 アンジ「...?」
 After she said that, I slowly opened my eyes―
 ev030c
 v00an1298
 アンジ「Eh?
 ...What's this?」
 The bag Belle was holding fell firmly into my hands.
 v01be1048
 ベル「T-that's... a present from everyone.」
 v00an1299
 アンジ「Everyone? How?」
 v01be1049
 ベル「Our puppet play for the Thanksgiving Festival was popular, so they gave us a bonus.」
 
 v01be1050
 ベル「And instead of dividing the money among everyone, we decided to buy a present for you...」
 
 v01be1051
 ベル「They all asked me to decide what the present would be, so I bought this.」
 v00an1300
 アンジ「......」
 v01be1052
 ベル「But, I'm not really used to doing something like this...」
 v00an1301
 アンジ「...That's why you had trouble?」
  So she didn't have trouble finding her way here, instead she had trouble choosing which present to buy.
 v01be1053
 ベル「...Yes.」
 After understanding what this bag she had gave me was, I calmed down slightly.
  Still, that said... I couldn't stop my own heart from racing.
 ev030d
 v00an1302
 アンジ「Y-you know, things like this... makes me feel really awkward.」
 v01be1054
 ベル「Eh?」
 v00an1303
 アンジ「Because you know, it's so sudden. And even if you say ‘everyone’, I don't really know who they are.」
 
 
 v01be1055
 ベル「...I don't know either.」
 v00an1304
 アンジ「Eh?
 But didn't you buy this...」
 v01be1056
 ベル「Yes, but I don't know anything other than that Wakaba gave the money.」
 
 ...So this was Wakaba's doing.
 v01be1057
 ベル「...Was it a bother after all?」
 v00an1305
 アンジ「No, of course not!」
 Even though I had admitted I felt awkward just now, there was no way I could have agreed to that while looking upon Belle's sad expression.
 
 Actually... I was really happy.
  But despite that, I had no idea what to say.
  That's why I'd gone off about something else and upset Belle instead.
 v00an1306
 アンジ「Er... thank you.」
 v01be1058
 ベル「...?
 So, does that mean you'll accept it?」
 v00an1307
 アンジ「Of course I will. This is a present from everyone, after all. I'd be damned if I say anything like ‘I don't want it.’」
 
 The faces of the members of our troupe floated one by one through my mind, and I thanked each of them within my heart.
 
 Of course, I'll thank them face to face when I meet them later. Still, I wonder how Wakaba will react.
 
 v00an1308
 アンジ「(―Will she feign ignorance? Or would she be grinning in satisfaction instead?)」
 ...Either way, I'll be just as grateful to her.

 v00an1309
 アンジ「Is it okay for me to open this?」
 v01be1059
 ベル「Yes, I do hope that you like it...」
 v00an1310
 アンジ「Dummy. You're the one that chose this, right? ...How could I not?」
 
 I removed the ribbon tied at the mouth of the bag, and slowly reached my hand inside.
 Even though I had already guessed at its contents from the packaging, I didn't think that it would really be―
 v00an1311
 アンジ「A one-piece?」
 v01be1060
 ベル「...What do you think?」
 v00an1312
 アンジ「Uh, um.」
 Even though I hadn't taken a good look at it, its design seemed to be really cute.
 But, for a girl like me who rolls up her sleeves in summer, prefers practicality to fashion, and plans on handing down her clothes to her sisters even while choosing them... should I really wear a dress like this?
 
 
 ev030b
 v00an1313
 アンジ「...H-hey, you won't laugh at me if I wear this, right?」
 v01be1061
 ベル「Why would I?」
 v00an1314
 アンジ「Because, what if it doesn't suit me...」
 v01be1062
 ベル「I think it suits you a lot, Miss Angelina.」
 Belle looked straight at me, and nodded firmly.
 v00an1315
 アンジ「(―I see...)」
 Of course Belle wouldn't have tried to choose a dress that didn't suit me.
 That's why I mustn't show hesitation in front of the one who chose this for me.
 v00an1316
 アンジ「...Could you stay here and wait for me? If you don't mind, I'll go back to the hotel and change into this.」
 
 
 v01be1063
 ベル「...Sure!」

 Even though I was reluctant to leave Belle behind, delighted as she was, I decided to head back to the hotel. 
 
 ...But.

 v01be1065
 ベル「...It's okay, it's not like I'll run away from here.」
 v00an1318
 アンジ「(―Man!)」
 Her words made me lose heart. Even though I felt a bit gloomy, I decided not to run, despite my desire to show it to Belle as soon as I can.
 
 But I'm not a child anymore... so I have to listen to what she says.
  When I reached a corner, I turned back to look... after confirming that Belle was nowhere to be seen, I took a deep breath, and then―
 
 v00an1319
 アンジ「...Time to speed-walk!」
 Evening was about to come.
  Even though I mustn't run, I must still do things as swiftly as I can.
  Since I'm an adult, after all.

 As I imagined Angelina coming back wearing the dress I'd bought for her, I couldn't help but feel a little nervous.
 
 Even though I told her not to run... in truth, I hope she'll come back quickly so that I can see how she looks in it.
 
 v01be1067
 ベル「(―This is probably the first time I've waited for someone with this kind of feeling.)」
 A long wait filled with both anticipation and unease.
  The intermingling of emotions like this produces an indescribable feeling of happiness.
 st01_d10
 v01be1068
 ベル「(―I hope she comes back quickly...)」
 I gazed at the river from the bridge, and dreamily wondered where it shall flow to.
 Until now, I had always been living together with Father. That had been so for days upon days.
 
 It was difficult for me to compare with these few days I have spent with Angelina.
  ...But.
 If I were to weigh the feeling of loneliness from leaving Father and the feeling I would have if Angelina were not here...
 
 If you were to ask me which was more unbearable, my answer would be the latter.
 st01_d03
 v01be1069

 This indescribable feeling spun in turmoil within my heart. ...Honestly, even comparing both of them is weird.

 v01be1070

 v00an1321

 Her words made me shake my head with all my might.
 v01be1072
 ベル「...Of course not, it's just as I imagined it to be.」
 It was true... she had appeared as the figure I had imagined inside my mind.
  At that time, I was hesitant whether the other dress might look better on her. 
 But now that I see it, this one-piece was definitely the right choice.
 I gathered up my courage, and...
 v01be1073
 ベル「It's perfect on you, Miss Angelina,」
  I told her.
 v00an1324
 アンジ「...Thank you.」
 Just by gazing at the smile Angelina showed me, I felt truly blessed.
  I wonder where this feeling came from?
 v00an1325
 アンジ「This one-piece bares my shoulders, just like yours. I've always worn long sleeves, so I'm not really used to this.」
 
 She smiled sheepishly as she rubbed her own arms.
 v00an1326
 アンジ「...But I'm sure I'll get used to it soon, if I move around a bit.」
 As she said that, she pointed towards a square not far away,
 v00an1327
 アンジ「Do you want to take a stroll there?」
  she invited me.
 v01be1074
 ベル「...Sure.」
 Even though we walked side by side as usual, somehow our paces didn't match and I was a few steps ahead of her.
 
 v00an1328
 アンジ「...I'm still not used to these new shoes.」
 v01be1075
 ベル「Ah, please don't force yourself. If your feet get blistered, it would hurt a lot.」
 v00an1329
 アンジ「Ufufu, thanks for worrying about me.」
 Soon, we had reached the square, and found there a secluded corner.
 As if she had thought of something, Angelina nodded a couple of times, patted my shoulders, and slowly made some distance between us.
 
 v01be1076
 ベル「(―I wonder what's she doing?)」
 And then, she silently spread her hands wide, and faced the sunset sky.
 v00an1330
 アンジ「...Oh Schwester, have you ever dreamed of flying in this sky?」
 
 
 That voice was Angelina's voice... and at the same time, it was also that of Princess Christina.
  It was one of the lines from the script Wakaba had given us.
 And the line after that was―

 From the castle, Princess Christina gazed out at the sky, and said to the angel known as the Schwester.

 v00an1332
 アンジ「...I too wish to see your figure dancing in the sky, unbound by anything. Furthermore―」
 
 v00an1333

 The desire to follow the angel as she flies from the castle...

 v00an1334
 アンジ「Why must I not?」

 v00an1335
 アンジ「...Then I ask, if you truly could fly in the sky, what shall become of me who would be left behind?」
 
 v01be1081
 ベル「That is...」
 v00an1336

 From the pocket of her new dress she'd just put on, she took out that Drop once more.

 アンジ「Even if you refuse again, I wanted to tell you straight that I hope you will accept it from the bottom of my heart.」

 アンジ「―Would you accept it?」
 v01be1098

 Throughout the trip, Wakaba had been working tirelessly on the play's script without anyone knowing, so that Angelina and Belle could practice their lines. 
 
 Of course, she did listen to their opinions of the script, which no doubt sped the writing along.
 
 But in the end, Wakaba still had to digest those opinions and apply them to her work on her own.
 
 Faced with the pressure of this challenge, undoubtedly there were times where she couldn't endure it.

 My typewriter was out of ink, and I couldn't wait until morning, so I'd gone out to buy another ribbon. But since it was quite late, there weren't many shops that were still open.
 
 
 When I finally found an open stationary shop and bought what I needed, it was already late at night.

 Angelina was going to the library to help out Cero today as well.

 v01be1105

 We are traveling... but I'm thinking too much.
 First of all, Angelina's just headed to the library not far from here, and she's not even taking anything with her.
 
 No matter how late she is, at most she'll be back at evening when the library closes.

 Had I forgotten to mind my own business and interrupted her private time?

 If I keep bothering her like this, she'll scold me for it some day.

 v06si0392
 シルヴ「...I said, who?」
 I was reminded of how Coco and Light scared me in the past... there's nothing more frightening than someone creeping around without you having any idea who it is.
 
 v06si0393
 シルヴ「I-I said who is it?!」
 My body was stiff with fear, and I could do nothing but stand there―
 st07_a01
 v07to0188
 トニー「...Hehe, this is payback.」
 That voice... was undoubtedly Tonino's. 
 v06si0394
 シルヴ「Y-you!
 What do you think you're doing?」
 I was a little shocked when I caught a whiff of his breath.
 Tonino, who never could hold his alcohol―
 st07_a00
 v07to0189
 トニー「Even I... can drink once in a while, you know.」
 ―had unexpectedly came back dead drunk.
 v06si0395
 シルヴ「(―Ah, oh no!)」
 As I came to my senses, I realized that I had to hide the ring I was wearing on my finger, but I couldn't find anywhere.
 
 With no other choice, I tried to hide my hand under a table, but―
 st07_a06
 v07to0190
 トニー「Hm?
 What are you hiding?」
 v06si0396
 シルヴ「I-it's nothing!」
 He rushed towards me, and grabbed my hand.
 Just like that, he discovered that I was wearing the ring.
 st07_a04
 v07to0191
 トニー「...So you found it.」
 v06si0397
 シルヴ「...T-this is, well...」
 I desperately tried to think of an excuse.
 Things that went missing for so long can't just be found like that.
 Where should I say that I found it so that he won't get suspicious?
 st07_a00
 v07to0192
 トニー「...Thank you.」
 v06si0398
 シルヴ「...Eh?」
 Words of gratitude had been the last thing I'd expected, and I replied stupidly.
 v06si0399
 シルヴ「Is that all? Don't you have anything else to say?」
  I started complaining, completely forgetting my own situation.
 st07_a04
 v07to0193
 トニー「...Ah, no. How should I say it?
 I'm satisfied just to see you wearing it, I guess?」
 ...It's just as I'd predicted of him some time ago,
  Tonino hadn't gotten angry... and instead forgiven me.
 v06si0400
 シルヴ「(―He shouldn't have did that...)」
 v06si0401
 シルヴ「Why haven't you noticed already, you fake lecher!」
 
 v06si0402
 シルヴ「(―He should have scolded me more for that...)」
 v06si0403
 シルヴ「It's because that you're always like this that I order you around and treat you like dirt...」
 v06si0404
 シルヴ「(―Why can't I be more honest with myself...)」
 v06si0405
 シルヴ「How am I supposed to feel good about us when you keep doing that?」
 Tonino, who was sitting on the floor, didn't reply to anything I had said.
 His blank expression was so amusing I just had to start teasing him.
 v06si0406
 シルヴ「Why do you always control yourself whenever we share the same bed? Are you trying to be a gentleman that isn't interested in women?」
 
 st07_a02
 v07to0194
 トニー「I didn't say anything like that.
 I'm just drunk right now.」
 So you'll pass on that... is that what you're trying to say?
 But I'm not going to let you run away with that kind of excuse.
 That's because... I can't control myself anymore either.
 v06si0407
 シルヴ「...Are you saying you can't get it up just because you drank some alcohol, boy?」
 st07_a06
 v07to0195
 トニー「...Whoa, now that's not something I can't pretend that I didn't hear.」
 v06si0408
 シルヴ「(―That's right, just like that...)」
 Once in a while, as long as you just reach out your hands to me―
 Even I'm able to be gentler to you...

 セロ「Wakaba, what good timing. I have something to tell you, are you busy?」
 
 v03wa1957
 ワカバ「Hm? What is it, what is it?」
 v04ce1860
 セロ「I think I'm ready to report to you the results of the investigation.」
 v03wa1958
 ワカバ「Really!
 I wanna hear, I wanna hear!」
 I'd met Cero in front of the hotel earlier. Originally we thought of going back to the room and talk, but since this was a rare opportunity when neither of us were busy, I took him shopping with me.
 
 v03wa1959
 ワカバ「So, what did you find?」
 In these few days during which Cero had shut himself inside the library, I was in the hotel all the while, writing the script. 
 
 Most of the script is finished, and there won't be any serious problems even if I have to revise something.
 
 All that's left is to listen to Cero's report and change it accordingly... that's what I intend to do.
 The problem was that we had set as our goal a scenario that was ‘as close to the true history as possible’, but is that something we can achieve? 
 
 st04_a02
 v04ce1861
 セロ「I'll start with the conclusion... I was not able to find the historical evidences that you wished for.」
 
 st04_a07
 v04ce1862
 セロ「―Which means, regrettably, it will be difficult to make portraying Ein as a good person flow well with the true history.」
 
 v03wa1960
 ワカバ「I see...」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1863
 セロ「Ein was certainly one of Princess Christina's most capable retainers, he was held in high regard by the people and said to be very loyal.」
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce1864
 セロ「But that's the very reason that final incident came as such a shock― thus making his name a byword for treachery.」
 
 v03wa1961
 ワカバ「...I see.」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1865
 セロ「Saying this might be a little redundant, but there are documents which agree with your perspective of Ein.」
 
 v03wa1962
 ワカバ「Really?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1866
 セロ「Yes, but those are all just written based upon speculation, and lack credibility.」
 
 According to Cero's research, all that speculation rested upon a single conspiracy theory in the end.
 
 st04_a03
 v04ce1867
 セロ「The more talented and outstanding a person is, the more enemies he will make, and the people who bear a grudge against him shall conspire to have him fall from grace... Most of them said this same thing.」
 
 v03wa1963
 ワカバ「...I guess. If there's a possibility that Ein is a good person, then that will be the most likely reason.」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1868
 セロ「...After that, I tried to investigate deeper into those books and find some evidence to prove that there was such a conspiracy, but...」
 
 v03wa1964
 ワカバ「You couldn't find any?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1869
 セロ「I found some, but the sources clearly stated that they were merely falsehoods... thus sending us to where we came from.」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1870
 セロ「Of course, the claim that those books are merely falsehoods is rather suspicious in itself, so there might be more to the truth of the matter.」
 
 
 st04_a07
 v04ce1871
 セロ「...Sorry, even though I made my report, there's no good news at all.」
 v03wa1965
 ワカバ「No, don't say that. Thank you for helping me investigate.」
 Even though I had dreamed of great things, reality is cruel, after all.
 v03wa1966
 ワカバ「It's just as you said, Cero... ‘Humans don't have the power to change the past.’」
 
 It's not that I had wanted to deny what he had told me in the beginning, before all this.
 It's just that, there was something I had believed in―
 st04_a06
 v04ce1872
 セロ「So, honestly... do you regret this?」
 v03wa1967
 ワカバ「...How should I say it. The impression of Ein inside my mind is pretty set, after all.」
 
 st04_a05
 v04ce1873
 セロ「What kind of person is he? The Ein in your mind's eye.」
 v03wa1968
 ワカバ「Hmm, let me think. Long hair as black as pitch, a handsome face... and the kind of person who doesn't smile much.」
 
 st04_a00
 v04ce1874
 セロ「Oh... did you see that in a book or something?」
 v03wa1969
 ワカバ「No, it's the figure I saw in my dreams. I just dramatized it a little.」
 v03wa1970
 ワカバ「So, what about the research on the clothing of the period?」
 st04_a01
 v04ce1875
 セロ「Yup. I had Angelina help out with that, and gathered some pretty accurate data.」
 
 Among the sheets of photocopied paper that Cero showed me were the clothing worn by nobles at that time, clothing used in the previous performances of The Angel's Guidance, and countless other pictures and illustrations.
 
 
 v03wa1971
 ワカバ「Amazing!
 Now that we have this, our stage clothing is set!」
 I stood to face Cero once more, and bowed my head deeply.
 v03wa1972
 ワカバ「Thank you so much, Cero. Thanks to you, I can now decide what we should do next.」
 
 st04_a02
 v04ce1876
 セロ「......」
 v03wa1973
 ワカバ「Even though we may have drifted away from our original goal, I will surely complete this work that I believe in.」
 
 v03wa1974
 ワカバ「...Of course, it will be somewhat different from the actual history. But I hope that I can present this work as a piece of art to an audience.」
 
 v03wa1975
 ワカバ「Furthermore, if we just keep pursuing reality... there won't be any room for dreams.」
 ―The past will not change.
 Even though Princess Christina will never be saved from her tragic fate...
 At the very least, I hope that she will be able to find happiness in the play that I write.
 v03wa1976
 ワカバ「I'm going to write a happy ending. That's the one thing I decided from the start that I must stay true to.」
 st04_a01
 v04ce1877
 セロ「...Yes, I think that would be great.」
 v03wa1977
 ワカバ「Alright!
 Now that it's decided, it's time to start revising!」
 ...Watch closely, Ein.
 For the sake of the day when you can finally be proven innocent, I'll start by presenting the truth in the form of this script!

 st04_a06
 v04ce1878
 セロ「In the end, this will just be fiction... right?」
 v03wa1978
 ワカバ「That's right.」
 st04_a03
 After hearing my answer, Cero closed his eyes and went deep into thought.
 v03wa1979
 ワカバ「...Is anything wrong?」
 Srhn_BGM03
 st04_a06
 v04ce1879
 セロ「No matter what the truth is, the end of the story must be a happy one. ...You're definitely not going to change that, right?」
 
 v03wa1980
 ワカバ「Yeah, of course.」
 After I nodded, Cero went silent for a while, and finally,
 st04_a07
 v04ce1880
 セロ「Actually, I still have something that I hesitated to tell you about,」
  he said.
 st04_a06
 v04ce1881
 セロ「―Do you remember what I said about finding ‘books that have evidence to prove a conspiracy?’」
 
 v03wa1981
 ワカバ「Well, you told me not long ago, so of course I remember.」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1882
 セロ「Among those books, there was the diary of a certain person.」
 v04ce1883
 セロ「In that diary was recorded a detailed explanation and confession of a certain incident that happened in the White Kingdom.」
 
 v03wa1982
 ワカバ「A detailed explanation... and confession?」
 st04_a07
 v04ce1884
 セロ「That diary was written by a person that had participated in a plan to cause Ein's downfall and regretted it, thus confessing his sins in a diary.」
 
 v03wa1983
 ワカバ「So did he mention the conspiracy theory?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1885
 セロ「Yes, the name of the person who wrote that diary was Hans Brant. He was a noble from the White Kingdom who had been sent as an ambassador to the Blue Kingdom.」
 
 v03wa1984
 ワカバ「...Isn't that great!
 If that's true...」
 st04_a03
 v04ce1886
 セロ「...If that's true, huh. Of course, that diary as well claimed to be nothing but falsehood.」
 v03wa1985
 ワカバ「...You mean it's fake?」
 v04ce1887
 セロ「Yeah. Moreover, its contents were about the same as the other books that suggested a conspiracy.」
 
 v03wa1986
 ワカバ「Well, then that's not enough.」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1888
 セロ「...Yeah. Were I still the me who had yet to set out on this journey from Moosgrun, I would have already given up.」
 
 st04_a02
 v04ce1889
 セロ「―But, you know. We might be able to prove that the diary is genuine.」
 v03wa1987
 ワカバ「...How can we do that?」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1890
 セロ「Coco holds the answer.」
 v03wa1988
 ワカバ「...By Coco, you mean... Coco?」
 st04_a02
 v04ce1891
 セロ「Yes, Coco was the witness to that incident that happened in the White Kingdom. In addition, inside Hans' diary was written something that could be able to prove that.」
 
 v03wa1989
 ワカバ「A-and what's that?」
 v04ce1892
 セロ「There was a single page in that diary that had the signature ‘CoCo’ on it. ...On the back of that page were entries the same as on the rest of the pages.」
 
 v03wa1990
 ワカバ「...T-that's amazing!
 Isn't this something incredible?!」
 st04_a06
 v04ce1893
 セロ「If the material and age of the paper, the ink that was used, and the signature from that page match... history might have to be rewritten.」
 
 v03wa1991
 ワカバ「S-so where is that diary?」
 st04_a08
 v04ce1894
 セロ「...Sorry, I asked the library officials to verify the original copy of the diary, so I don't have it at the moment.」
 
 v03wa1992
 ワカバ「Ah, b-but that's okay!
 Now...」
 If that diary can be proven as genuine, then we might be able to prove that Ein is innocent!
 
 This is a great discovery!!
