<00000006> After our journey to the Red Capital ends, we'll be going back to our hometown ― Moosgrun.
<00000007> 
<00000008> But, once I realized that we're finally going to head back... I couldn't help but feel a sudden sense of reluctance at ending our journey.
<00000009> 
<00000010> I remembered all the things that had happened since the day we departed.
<00000011> Like buying tickets in the White Capital, being seen naked by Cero... somehow all the things I remembered were times when I'd messed up, it was a little sad to think about―
<00000012> 
<00000013> Among those moments I recalled, there was one that I was still concerned about.
<00000014> black450
<00000015> bg14d03
<00000016> And that was the time when Cero and I had gone to the Dornstein Castle at night.
<00000017> sv019d
<00000018> After climbing up to the castle wall, I thought Cero had gotten fed up with me and left, but in fact he was still waiting quietly for me below.
<00000019> 
<00000020> black450
<00000021> In the end,
<00000022> 
<00000023>  I'd kissed his cheek out of impulse, and I still remembered that at that moment, he had said ‘Thank you.’
<00000024> 
<00000025> I still wanted to know what he had meant by those words.
<00000026> black450
<00000027> bg18b01
<00000028> But, I hadn't had any chance to ask him since then.
<00000029> Furthermore, it's been long enough that he might have even forgotten about it.

<00000031> v03wa1324
<00000032> ワカバ「...The opportunity doesn't come easily, I guess.」
<00000033> If ever there's a chance to ask him, it would be now, while we're still on the trip.
<00000034> ...With that thought, I wrote ‘Wait for me in the lobby’ on a piece of notepaper, and slipped it into my pocket.
<00000035> 
<00000036> st03_c00
<00000037> Since it's Cero, when he sees this note, he'll definitely wait obediently for me until I appear in front of him.
<00000038> 
<00000039> Since we planned to gather in front of the station, I'll go to the lobby when everyone else has left the hotel... then I'll ask Cero the meaning of that ‘Thank you’ as we walk together to the station.
<00000040> 
<00000041> 
<00000042> st03_c04
<00000043> And then, no matter what kind of answer I get, I can just change the subject by saying ‘Everyone is waiting for us!’ and running off ahead.
<00000044> 
<00000045> v03wa1325
<00000046> ワカバ「(―What a nice idea!)」
<00000047> To execute this plan, I'd arrived in front of the door to his room, now I just need to slip this piece of paper under the door―
<00000048> 
<00000049> But, somehow I couldn't find the courage to do it.
<00000050> st03_c07
<00000051> v03wa1326
<00000052> ワカバ「...Ah, forget it!」
<00000053> What would happen if he didn't notice the note... wouldn't I become really pathetic for doing this?
<00000054> st03_c02
<00000055> v03wa1327
<00000056> ワカバ「This belonged in the trash in the first place!」
<00000057> I threw that pathetic piece of paper into the trash bin in the lobby, and went ahead before anyone else to the train station by myself.

<00000108> I looked at the time- there was still a couple of minutes left before departure!
<00000109> At least I wasn't carrying much, since I had given the luggage to Light earlier. I grabbed Cero's wrist, and headed for the station.

<00000164> We'd thought of asking Rein to help, but we'd been asking for his assistance since the start of the trip up to that matter in Aubergine. If we continue to ask him for more money... frankly, it's like robbery already. 
<00000165> 
<00000166> 
<00000167> Then let's just hitchhike! ...was what Wakaba had suggested. I agreed, thinking that this might be part of the fun of traveling, and then we ended up like this.
<00000168> 
<00000169> Though there had been a generous old man who had let us ride with him, the car engine went dead in the middle of the trip.
<00000170> 
<00000171> The old man told us that we could find another car if we left the highway. Trusting his advice, we started walking, and then found out that we had probably gone on the wrong road.
<00000172> 
<00000173> After an hour, among these calm and peaceful scenery... all the cars that passed us by were two-seated convertibles that weren't calm or peaceful at all.
<00000174> 
<00000175> We thought that we'd be able to find some place to stay after walking all these while, but―

<00000289> No matter how much they quarreled, in the end they always came to a mutual understanding.
<00000290> I'd always been thinking about that... wishing that my relationship with Wakaba could be like that too... wishing, wishing... is all I could do.
<00000291> 
<00000292> If she didn't accept my confession, things would never be the same between us... whenever I thought of that, I became hesitant.

<00000301> After finally telling her my feelings, I had realized for the first time―
<00000302> ―that it was just as Wakaba had said.
<00000303> If I faced my own feelings, I could do this anytime.
<00000304> It's because of my fear that it would spoil our relationship that I had driven us further apart―
<00000305> And by doing that I had nearly lost what I held dear.
<00000306> ―As I held Wakaba in my arms, I finally understood that.

<00000109> 
<00000110> 
<00000111> ...But, this play is different.
<00000112> In this play, a different future shall be shown!
<00000113> st01_b00
<00000114> The girl who arrived at the White Kingdom was an angel sent by the Red Kingdom.
<00000115> Due to miscommunication, she was stopped before the front of the castle gate.

<00000151> Originally, the script had no name for her, and that was the reason I called her Schwester.
<00000152> 
<00000153> But we changed our mind, and decided to let Princess Christina give the angel that name.
<00000154> 
<00000155> Because of that, the relationship between the princess and the angel grew much closer instantly.
<00000156> Since the day they had met, they were bound by an invisible string of intimacy, though of course... nobody else around them was able to realize that.
<00000157> 
<00000158> But, as time went on, someone who realized the bond between the two appeared.

<00000173> and reminded the angel of her place.

<00000462> ...Alright, now comes the main problem.
<00000463> In the script, Valery's scheming caused Ein to be late for his audience.
<00000464> 
<00000465> black450
<00000466> But in reality, the actor for Ein actually was running late, so we needed to ad-lib.

<00000546> And before my eyes stands the man who protects her.
<00000547> Of course, I already know the outcome of this conflict.
<00000548> Even if I were to ad-lib, I knew the winner would not change.

<00000557> Then, from ‘The Tragedy of the White Kingdom's Downfall’ which the Red and Blue Kingdoms' conspire to engineer, the focus of the play shifted to the relationship between Christina and Schwester.

<00000338> v11re0196
<00000339> レイン「I felt a sense of responsibility, and continued my research because of that...」
<00000340> 
<00000341> My real name is Ein Ronberg.
<00000342> But I was not the regent of the White Kingdom... I was just a migrant from overseas.
<00000343> I was a clown before I came to this country.
<00000344> My stage name at that time had been Rein Helmer.
<00000345> All I'd done was add an ‘R’ to the front of my real name.
<00000346> 
<00000347> 
<00000348> There was only one reason I was forced to make a living under a stage name.
<00000349> 
<00000350> 
<00000351> 
<00000352> With the same name as the famed traitor Ein Ronberg, I was unable to find a job, and was harassed constantly for no reason.
<00000353> 
<00000354> At first, I had hated Ein.
<00000355> I had came all the way to this land to seek refuge from war.
<00000356> But instead, I had suffered a fate more brutal than that of my homeland.
<00000357> Thus, I changed my name to Rein Helmer.
<00000358> Even though I disliked the fact that I had to live under a fake name rather than my true one...
<00000359> I had become a doll engineer regardless of that, honed my skills, and slowly climbed to the apex of the profession.
<00000360> 
<00000361> ...By doing so, I was able to participate in the Dorn's Memory Revival Project.
<00000362> I had studied Efa's original design, and created a new body for her.
<00000363> And then, I transferred all the gems to that new body that had once dwelled within Efa's body.
<00000364> The project's supposed purpose was to revitalize the doll technology that was slipping into obsolescence, but what we had actually done... was but a crude act of disrespect for the dead.
<00000365> 
<00000366> Even so, there was a reason that I had continued participating in that project, even becoming the core member of it.
<00000367> 
<00000368> I had speculated that if the new Efa awoke to the sight of a woman that looked much like Christina, there would be a greater possibility of recovering her memories.
<00000369> 
<00000370> Thus, a person who looked like Christina Dorn was chosen from among the community of doll engineers- a woman named Root, who was a colleague of mine.
<00000371> 
<00000372> At the conference where I had met her, I had fallen in love at first sight. 
<00000373> That was the main reason I had taken up this project.
<00000374> Now that I recalled, I was so naive and foolish at that time...
<00000375> ...But the time I had spent with her back then had been everything to me.
<00000376> I had revived Efa's body, and Root had awakened Efa's heart.
<00000377> Regrettably, that marked the end of our collaboration, since soon after that came a ruthless order from the country that the project be stopped.
<00000378> 
<00000379> They did not care about the results of the project, and wanted only to abandon doll engineering.
<00000380> 
<00000381> In exchange for a large sum of money, I was forced to promise to never speak of this project again, and we were separated from each other to eke out what future we could.
<00000382> 
<00000383> 
<00000384> ...If she's still alive right now...
<00000385> I'm sure she must be very cute, even as an old grandmother.
<00000386> Lastly, I shall tell you the secret I have kept to myself.
<00000387> I've betrayed this country without anyone's knowledge.
<00000388> You know, that grave of Ein Ronberg's in the White Kingdom?
<00000389> His remains are not there.
<00000390> I stole them away. Why, you ask? It is because I wanted to bury him in the graveyard in Silberg.
<00000391> 
<00000392> Though regrettably, this grave did not had his name carved upon it, I felt that it was a hundred times better... than being trod upon for all eternity.
<00000393> 
<00000394> And then, when the time comes for me to die and enter that grave.
<00000395> In accordance with my will, I wish my real name to be written upon that gravestone.

<00000326> I thought that she would suck the tip of my breast, but instead, she planted kisses down along my body.
<00000327> And then, without stopping, she reached her fingers inside of me and started to stir me up.
<00000328> Each and every one of her actions expressed her feelings for me, and they filled my whole body.

<00000043> As the gentle breeze passed by, it tried but failed to carry away the picnic sheet we had spread. Just like that, we started enjoying our time leisurely.

<00000052> Belle was from Silberg.
<00000053> ―And I was from the Blue Capital.
<00000054> In idle conversation, we told each other what had happened during the times when we weren't together... and then, naturally, we asked each other for more details.

<00000056> We spoke of the things we had done, and the things we had wanted to do.
<00000057> As our conversation drifted through the past that we can never return to...

<00000108> That's because... a sense of melancholy had filled her eyes.

<00000009> Oh Tonino, always such a coward now that we've come this far.

<00000023> トニー「I'm lucky to be able to do this with you, but... you know, I'd rather be on top...」
<00000024> As Tonino kept on mumbling complaints, I forced a kiss upon him to shut him up.

<00000032> シルヴ「Al-right, boy. Be good.」

<00000036> シルヴ「...Does it feel good?」
<00000037> I don't have to ask to know the answer to that, since his reactions clearly showed his excitement. I couldn't help but feel excited too.

<00000044> トニー「Please forgive me.」
<00000045> Whether he admitted it or not, he was already fully hard. So, even though he knew that resistance was impossible, he still looked at me with a pout, seeming dissatisfied.

<00000051> Even if he does intend to protest, if that's the most he can say, all I'll do is laugh.

<00000054> v06si0186
<00000055> シルヴ「Oh, but aren't you just a little older than Light?」

<00000060> v06si0187
<00000061> シルヴ「Whatever, it's all the same in my eyes... right?」
<00000062> I drew closer to Tonino's bottom half, and gave a light kiss to the tip of his shaft.
<00000063> v07to0233
<00000064> トニー「Nn... guh.」
<00000065> Electrified, his body tensed up.

<00000068> シルヴ「Hey, Tonino?
<00000069> Do you really want to be an adult even though your body is at my mercy now?」
<00000070> The irresistible stimulation caused liquid to leak from the tip of his shaft, flowing onto the hand that roughly caressed it as if drawing a circle with a pen.
<00000071> v07to0234
<00000072> トニー「We're doing something like this that kids can't do, isn't your question entirely moot?」

<00000075> v07to0235

<00000079> シルヴ「Eh?
<00000080> Is that so?」
<00000081> I looked carefully over Tonino's body at my leisure.
<00000082>  Then, I stretched out my hand and explored his jawline.
<00000083> ev053i
<00000084> v06si0191
<00000085> シルヴ「Hm, well, your finely chiseled face is certainly different from him.」
<00000086> And I nodded as my hand experienced the bristly feel of his chin.
<00000087> v06si0192
<00000088> シルヴ「...And you have a beard too,」
<00000089> just like that, my fingers slid down his neck, and came to his chest.
<00000090> v06si0193
<00000091> シルヴ「And you've even got muscles!」
<00000092> My fingers continued to slide down, and finally reached his groin.
<00000093> ev053k
<00000094> v06si0194
<00000095> シルヴ「And down around here, there is quite a significant difference.」
<00000096> I tightly gripped onto his fully erect shaft.

<00000098> トニー「Significant difference, you say... have you... seen theirs?!」
<00000099> ev053l

<00000103> ev053i
<00000104> v06si0196
<00000105> シルヴ「Obviously I know it'd be different from Light and Cero's, even without looking. More like, if theirs were the same as yours, then that would be quite a shock.」
<00000106> v07to0237
<00000107> トニー「...Who knows. It's been a long time since we've done anything like this, I thought you'd already forgotten.」
<00000108> Tonino said, grumbling.
<00000109> v06si0197
<00000110> シルヴ「Well, I don't know anything what those kids got, but yours... is at my beck and call.」
<00000111> v07to0238
<00000112> トニー「...Oh really?」
<00000113> Seems like he wasn't happy that I haven't ‘visited’ him in quite a while. I guess it is a little mean when I never give him any satisfaction because of my mood.
<00000114> 
<00000115> v06si0198
<00000116> シルヴ「Ooh, I can't really hear you. ...Still, I guess maybe I did forget about you recently?」
<00000117> v07to0239
<00000118> トニー「...Oi oi.」
<00000119> Still, I'm not going to listen to his complaints.

<00000121> v06si0199
<00000122> シルヴ「Well, just forget about it. Aren't I doing this to you right now?」
<00000123> I lightly stroked up and down as I moistened it a little.
<00000124> 
<00000125> v06si0200
<00000126> シルヴ「As an apology for what I've done all this while, I'll satisfy you today.」
<00000127> Tonight, I'll be the aggressive one... a night like this isn't bad once in a while.
<00000128> 
<00000129> v07to0240
<00000130> トニー「...Well, I guess there's no way out for me today.」

<00000133> シルヴ「Man, do you want me to say it in another way?」
<00000134> I stretched and planted a light kiss on Tonino's cheek.
<00000135> v07to0241
<00000136> トニー「No, don't use words, tell me with your body.」
<00000137> After seemingly giving up, Tonino slowly reached his hand for my breast.

<00000139> ev053g
<00000140> v06si0202
<00000141> シルヴ「Nn...」
<00000142> As my breast was fondled, I continued stimulating his shaft.
<00000143>  Though using my mouth would be much faster, there's no way I'm gonna do that kind of thing.
<00000144> At this kind of time, it's much better to keep teasing and teasing him just like this... he definitely won't be able to endure it.
<00000145> 
<00000146> I was treating this like a game, wondering when he would start begging.
<00000147> ev053e
<00000148> v06si0203
<00000149> シルヴ「Could you... massage a little more gently?」
<00000150> I ordered him.
<00000151> v07to0242
<00000152> トニー「...Then, could you use your mouth?」
<00000153> v06si0204
<00000154> シルヴ「Don't reply to a question with a question, idiot!」
<00000155> I aimed a poke at his forehead.
<00000156>  There's no way I'm gonna do that so easily!
<00000157> black450
<00000158> ev053m
<00000159> With that in mind, I wrapped my fingers around his excited shaft, and continued slowly massaging it.
<00000160> While playing with the most sensitive part, the tip... when I noticed him reacting, I immediately stopped.
<00000161> Then, after waiting for a while until he cooled down, I resumed stroking up and down again.
<00000162> v07to0243
<00000163> トニー「...You're doing that on purpose!」
<00000164> He grabbed my waist, and his face grew sullen as he said that.
<00000165> ev053p
<00000166> v06si0205
<00000167> シルヴ「Man, you're really acting like a kid.」
<00000168> I giggled.
<00000169> v07to0244
<00000170> トニー「Tch... fine, whatever. I'm just a kid anyway...」
<00000171> Giving up, Tonino lay down with his arms and legs spread wide.
<00000172> ev053o
<00000173> v06si0206
<00000174> シルヴ「Fufu... it's good that you understand.」
<00000175> I concentrated on stroking Tonino. This time, I'm not just gonna stop halfway.

<00000177> ev053m

<00000180> 「（―Maybe this is enough tonight?

<00000182> As I thought of that, I increased the speed of my hand movements.
<00000183> v07to0245
<00000184> トニー「Wait... Syl... via.」
<00000185> Suddenly, Tonino's body became stiff in an instant.
<00000186> v06si0208
<00000187> シルヴ「How is it?
<00000188> Does it feel good?」
<00000189> With as much skin contact as I'd had with him in the past, there's no way I wouldn't know his sensitive spots.
<00000190> 
<00000191> v06si0209
<00000192> シルヴ「...Come on, just let it out quickly.」

<00000194> トニー「N-no way...」
<00000195> He was most sensitive at the lower part of his shaft.

<00000197> v06si0210
<00000198> シルヴ「It's okay, you can make a little noise. I love it... when a boy moans.」
<00000199> v07to0247
<00000200> トニー「D-damn you...」
<00000201> That's why, I was pressing that part with my palm, while stroking―
<00000202> v07to0248
<00000203> トニー「...Hey, I-I can't stand it any longer...」
<00000204> ev053o
<00000205> v06si0211
<00000206> シルヴ「Atta boy, good of you to be honest...」
<00000207> ev053q
<00000208> v07to0504
<00000209> トニー「Ugh, uooo!?」
<00000210> white450
<00000211> ev053u
<00000212> v06si0741
<00000213> シルヴ「Kyah!」
<00000214> v06si0742
<00000215> シルヴ「W-what kind of idiot does that all of a sudden?!」
<00000216> v07to0505
<00000217> トニー「...I held it back as long as I could.」
<00000218> ev053r
<00000219> v06si0743
<00000220> シルヴ「...Man, clean it up yourself...」
<00000221> v07to0506
<00000222> トニー「...Silvia, I'm not gonna let you run away tonight, you know?」
<00000223> He murmured, then suddenly got up.
<00000224> black450
<00000225> v06si0212
<00000226> シルヴ「W-what are you doing?」
<00000227> v07to0249
<00000228> トニー「...What else! Don't treat people like kids!」
<00000229> v06si0213
<00000230> シルヴ「Eh...?」
<00000231> As he said that, Tonino forced me down on the bed.
<00000232> ev054b
<00000233> v06si0214
<00000234> シルヴ「W-wait, Tonino...」
<00000235> v07to0251
<00000236> トニー「It's been so long. Now, I wonder if this body you've forgotten for so long can still make you feel good?」
<00000237> Full of excitement, I stripped off Silvia's jeans and underwear, and had my fill of groping her butt.
<00000238> v07to0252
<00000239> トニー「(―It's been so long since I felt this sensation, too...)」
<00000240> Just by thinkin that, I regained my erection again.
<00000241>  Even so, Silvia's eyebrows creased... she turned her head, looked at me,
<00000242> v06si0215
<00000243> シルヴ「Hey, Tonino. Shouldn't we stop here after all?」
<00000244> and asked me that all of a sudden.
<00000245> v07to0253
<00000246> トニー「Why?
<00000247> You're the one who invited me, you know.」
<00000248> v06si0216
<00000249> シルヴ「But... the play is the day after tomorrow, right?」
<00000250> v07to0254
<00000251> トニー「That's why we have to do it now while we can.」
<00000252> My preparation was complete, and all I had to do was stick it in.
<00000253> 
<00000254> 
<00000255> v07to0255
<00000256> トニー「Also, if we stop now... who knows when we might have another chance.」
<00000257> ev054d
<00000258> v06si0217
<00000259> シルヴ「Hmph. You're pretty greedy.」
<00000260> She sighed, seeming like she had given up.
<00000261> v06si0218
<00000262> シルヴ「Oh well, fine. ...So, are we gonna do it like this?」
<00000263> v07to0256
<00000264> トニー「Well, if you leave it up to me.」
<00000265> But, since the position made her use her arms to support herself, she complained.
<00000266> ev054b
<00000267> v06si0219
<00000268> シルヴ「...This position is tough on my arms.」
<00000269> v07to0257
<00000270> トニー「Is it because of your weight?」
<00000271> v06si0220
<00000272> シルヴ「Idiot, do you wanna die?」
<00000273> She said as she narrowed her eyes and glared at me... seems like she's seriously getting angry.
<00000274> v07to0257_a
<00000275> トニー「...Well, if you're the one who killed me, I'd be satisfied.」
<00000276> I joked while offering my neck to her mouth.
<00000277> v06si0222
<00000278> シルヴ「Hmph!
<00000279> Tonino, you dummy!」
<00000280> All of a sudden, Silvia nipped my neck with her canines.
<00000281> v07to0258
<00000282> トニー「Ououououch!」
<00000283> v06si0223
<00000284> シルヴ「...Hmph, wasn't that just a love bite?」
<00000285> v07to0259
<00000286> トニー「Uwah, I'm bleeding...」
<00000287> I clutched my neck dramatically, and acted as if I was going to faint.
<00000288> v06si0224
<00000289> シルヴ「N-no way!?
<00000290> Are you alright, Tonino?
<00000291> I didn't meant to do that...」
<00000292> v07to0260
<00000293> トニー「I'm kidding.」
<00000294> I laughed all of a sudden, but it seemed like she doesn't think it was funny,
<00000295> v06si0225
<00000296> シルヴ「Idiot!」
<00000297> and raised her leg kicking mine.
<00000298> v07to0261
<00000299> トニー「Ouuuucch!」
<00000300> If she had kicked my shin, I would have really been hurting.
<00000301> v06si0226
<00000302> シルヴ「Hmph!
<00000303> You must be acting, anyway.」
<00000304> v07to0262
<00000305> トニー「...Yeah, but I'm not gonna be acting from now on.」
<00000306> When I have such a delicious dish in front of me for the first time in a while, I mustn't let it go to waste by fooling around. 
<00000307> I must savor this to the fullest.
<00000308> With that in mind, I reached my hands for her buxom breasts.
<00000309> ev054c
<00000310> v06si0227
<00000311> シルヴ「Ah...」
<00000312> v07to0263
<00000313> トニー「You're still sensitive as usual.」
<00000314> That sweet moan in addition to her reaction, instantly made me hard again.
<00000315> v07to0264
<00000316> トニー「Here, too...」
<00000317> I reached my other hand to the lower part of her body.
<00000318> ev054b
<00000319> v06si0228
<00000320> シルヴ「...Ah, no...」
<00000321> Even though I haven't touched her there yet, she was already drenched, transparent liquid flowing down her leg.
<00000322> v07to0265
<00000323> トニー「Oi oi, could you not get so horny before I even do anything?」
<00000324> v06si0229
<00000325> シルヴ「...O-of course I'm not!
<00000326> I was waiting for you.」
<00000327> As she said that, Silvia lifted her butt, and lightly shook it.
<00000328> v07to0266
<00000329> トニー「...I see, well, sorry.」
<00000330> I reached my hand for her breast.
<00000331> ev054a
<00000332> v06si0230
<00000333> シルヴ「Aa... nn.」
<00000334> Her back suddenly arched as I did that. Pleased by her reaction, I slowly guided my shaft inside the crevice between her thighs.
<00000335> 
<00000336> black450
<00000337> ev054e
<00000338> v07to0267
<00000339> トニー「Fu, haa, haa...!」
<00000340> The sensation of tightness as I moved inside her felt so good it made me grow even bigger.
<00000341> v07to0268
<00000342> トニー「This is great, Silvia...!
<00000343> You're still so tight as usual.」
<00000344> ev054f
<00000345> v06si0231
<00000346> シルヴ「I-idiot!
<00000347> Don't say... nn, something weird like... that!」
<00000348> She retorted with a red face, though that's one of the cute things about her.
<00000349> 
<00000350> v07to0269
<00000351> トニー「It's okay for you to make a little noise, you know. It's not like I mind that.」
<00000352> I smacked my hips against hers intensely, and as she felt that, she reacted by gripping her hands tightly.
<00000353> ev054g
<00000354> v06si0232
<00000355> シルヴ「Ah, haa, haa, aa, ngh!」
<00000356> Her voice, as if she was trying to endure herself, really tickled my carnal instincts.
<00000357> It felt really good fondling her breast as it shook with the rhythm of me moving my hips.
<00000358> v07to0270
<00000359> トニー「By the way... about the ring earlier.」
<00000360> ev054f
<00000361> v06si0233
<00000362> シルヴ「Eh!?」
<00000363> Those words made her body stiffen up in an instant.
<00000364> v07to0271
<00000365> トニー「Oucch!
<00000366> Relax, Silvia!」
<00000367> ev054g
<00000368> v06si0234
<00000369> シルヴ「Ah, s-sorry...」
<00000370> She exhaled heavily, and adjusted the tightness of her insides to an optimum level. As I moved my hips, I continued talking.
<00000371> 
<00000372> 
<00000373> v07to0272
<00000374> トニー「It's really great that you were able to find it.」
<00000375> I looked at my own ring finger, and couldn't help but laugh.
<00000376> Even I thought how out of character it was for me to consider something like matching rings.
<00000377> ev054f
<00000378> v06si0235
<00000379> シルヴ「...Y-yeah...」
<00000380> v07to0273
<00000381> トニー「Where did you find it?」
<00000382> v06si0236
<00000383> シルヴ「That's, not... really, important, right...?」
<00000384> Why are you getting shy all of a sudden?
<00000385> v07to0274
<00000386> トニー「(...Oh well, whatever. Rather than that, now is more important...)」
<00000387> She's a really whimsical person, so who knows when she'll get into the mood again like this.
<00000388> ev054e
<00000389> v07to0275
<00000390> トニー「Haa, haa, haa...」
<00000391> v06si0237
<00000392> シルヴ「Ah, haa, haa...... this feels... good...」
<00000393> Silvia arched her back, and following that movement, her insides grew tighter.
<00000394> 
<00000395> v07to0276
<00000396> トニー「It's been a while... since we've done this... I'm getting a little...」
<00000397> ev054f
<00000398> v06si0238
<00000399> シルヴ「Are you... going to come?」
<00000400> v07to0277
<00000401> トニー「O-of course not... though I want to say that...」
<00000402> ev054e
<00000403> v06si0239
<00000404> シルヴ「Nn... aah...」
<00000405> We both knew that we were almost at our limit.
<00000406> v07to0278
<00000407> トニー「...Sorry... but I might be a little early.」
<00000408> I pressed firmly against her round, pale bottom.
<00000409> ev054g
<00000410> v06si0240
<00000411> シルヴ「Uu, nn... b-but...」

<00000414> ev054h
<00000415> v06si0241
<00000416> シルヴ「N-nothing... as long as you feel good... that's fine.」
<00000417> v07to0280
<00000418> トニー「That's quite a cute thing you said...」
<00000419> Silvia clutched the bedsheet, and closed her eyes.
<00000420> ev054e
<00000421> v06si0242
<00000422> シルヴ「Ah, ah, ah, aah, ngh, ngh, nggh!」
<00000423> As her body trembled and shook, it only stimulated me further.
<00000424> 
<00000425> v07to0281
<00000426> トニー「I-I'm, c-coming...」

<00000428> v06si0243
<00000429> シルヴ「Nn...!」
<00000430> Silvia raised up her hips high.

<00000437> v07to0283
<00000438> トニー「Ku, ah...!」
<00000439> I held her waist tightly, and poured every last drop into her body.
<00000440> ev054k
<00000441> v06si0245
<00000442> シルヴ「Aah... if you came inside...」
<00000443> Silvia murmured with a blank face, surprised.
<00000444> v07to0284
<00000445> トニー「...Sorry, if anything happens, I'll take responsibility...」
<00000446> ev054l

<00000457> The next time we do this will be after the play ends?」

<00000463> シルヴ「...A-ah. If I'd known this would have happened, I wouldn't have gotten out the ring.」
<00000464> v07to0286
<00000465> トニー「So you didn't lose it and find it again today?」

<00000470> トニー「Yup, yup. It was lonely.」
<00000471> v06si0251

<00000473> v07to0288

<00000002> After I came into the room Wakaba was lodging in, we sat on the bed, facing each other... unable to calm down within such a close distance to each other, we were at a loss how to break this awkward atmosphere.
<00000003> 
<00000004> 
<00000005> At times like this I suppose I, being the man, should take the initiative by suggesting ‘can I kiss you?’, right?
<00000006> 
<00000007> As I shifted my vision to the corner of the room, thinking about that, I heard the sound of clothes brushing against each other beside me.
<00000008> 
<00000009> ev048a
<00000010> And when I turned my head to look back at her, attracted by that noise―
<00000011> 
<00000012> 
<00000013> v03wa2997
<00000014> ワカバ「Don't stare so much...」
<00000015> She was there, but without me noticing, she'd taken off her skirt.
<00000016> Those white thighs of hers took my vision hostage.
<00000017> v04ce1055a
<00000018> セロ「Uh, um...」
<00000019>  I had no idea what to say.
<00000020> v03wa2998
<00000021> ワカバ「...Cero. You... didn't want to?」
<00000022> She said with an uneasy voice as she embraced me, dazed with confusion.
<00000023> What was she referring to? Being with her? Or the kiss? Or... the thing that I imagined we're about to do? I couldn't tell.
<00000024> 
<00000025> But, whichever it was... I'm not going to refuse her.
<00000026> v04ce1056
<00000027> セロ「O-of course not!」
<00000028> I hugged Wakaba tightly, and our bodies pressed together... that was the answer to all of our questions. 
<00000029> 
<00000030> ev048c
<00000031> v03wa2999
<00000032> ワカバ「Ah...nn!」
<00000033> Wakaba closed her eyes and let out a pleasant voice.
<00000034> The sensation of her smooth skin made my body heat up.
<00000035> v04ce1057
<00000036> セロ「(―Aah, I guess things are going to get awkward in this position...)」
<00000037> I was getting an erection... though I tried to think of something to deal with that, but in the end I couldn't stop it.
<00000038> 
<00000039> The sensation of her skin through my hands made her seem so small and fragile within my arms as I embraced her.
<00000040> 
<00000041> Within my arms wrapped around her, I felt the trembling of her body ease, and she felt more like a girl than ever before.
<00000042> 
<00000043> ev048b
<00000044> v03wa3000
<00000045> ワカバ「C-Cero...?」
<00000046>  Wakaba looked up to me with a reddened face.
<00000047> v03wa3001
<00000048> ワカバ「...What are you thinking right now?」
<00000049> For a moment, her sudden question put me at a loss for words.
<00000050> v04ce1058
<00000051> セロ「Nothing really... I just had the feeling you're more of a girl than I expected.」
<00000052> v03wa3002
<00000053> ワカバ「...So you've never really seen me as a girl before, I see.」
<00000054> v04ce1059
<00000055> セロ「That's not what I mean. I meant that looking at you right now makes me feel that you're more of a girl.」
<00000056> To prove that I wasn't lying, I hugged her tighter.
<00000057> v03wa3003
<00000058> ワカバ「...Cero...」
<00000059> v04ce1060
<00000060> セロ「It's because it's here and now that I must tell you...」
<00000061> I buried my face in Wakaba's neck.
<00000062>  My nose was filled with the fluffy, sweet smell of her girlishness... and then,
<00000063> v04ce1061
<00000064> セロ「I love you,」
<00000065>  I confessed to her.
<00000066> ev048c
<00000067> v03wa3004

<00000231> ワカバ「Ah... haa, haa, nn.」

<00000266> ワカバ「...Haa, aaaah!」
<00000267> As she shuddered once, her nails sank into the pillow she was holding.
<00000268> As I watched her reaction, I slowly moved my fingers in her.
<00000269> Just by doing that, hot liquid was flowing out from her insides already.
<00000270> v04ce1088

<00000272> I drew closer to Wakaba's wet lower body, kissed her, and then softly began sucking.

<00000274> I slowly licked the juices of her love flowing down her body, savoring their slightly sweet taste.

<00000290> ワカバ「...Thank you.」

<00000316> Her body trembled, she arched her back, and she kept on shaking her head left and right.
<00000317> Watching Wakaba's pained reaction, I eased my strength, and moved my hips much more slowly.

<00000333> ワカバ「Nn, haa, haa, au...!」
<00000334> I hugged Wakaba's waist towards me while her hands pressed against mine, pulling out, then repeating. My movements were much quicker than earlier as I stirred up the inside of her body.

<00000430> セロ「(―We both got into a fight, I was slapped, and I got a nosebleed.)」
<00000431> I wonder if an excuse like that would work when the time comes?

<00000004> Cero hugged me much more tightly then usual.
<00000005>  And then, he lifted my shirt... and gently kissed my breast.

<00000013> v03wa1078
<00000014> ワカバ「I'm not cold.」
<00000015> I answered honestly.

<00000018> ev050e
<00000019> Cero nodded, and buried his face in my cleavage.
<00000020> v03wa1079
<00000021> ワカバ「No... Ah, aah.」
<00000022> My breasts aren't really that big... and if he touches them like that, he'll realize... this is embarrassing.

<00000024> ev050f
<00000025> v04ce1116
<00000026> セロ「...Wakaba, I love you.」
<00000027> After saying that, he immediately started kissing my breasts once again.
<00000028>  And then, he cupped my small breast in his right hand.

<00000035> セロ「What's wrong, Wakaba?」
<00000036> Cero turned his gaze to the expression on my face, and when our eyes met, my face grew redder than before.

<00000044> He buried his face between my breasts once more, and kissed me there.

<00000047> セロ「You don't need to worry about that. After all, Wakaba, you didn't choose to have breasts like these.」
<00000048> Cero said with a chuckle, embarrassing me further.
<00000049> v03wa1082
<00000050> ワカバ「But that's because... I don't have any confidence in them.」

<00000070> I could find no words to answer him.
<00000071> Even though now I don't have to worry he'll reject me because of my breast size, I've been worried about this for a long time. If he accepts me as I am this easily, I'll feel troubled―

<00000074> v04ce1124
<00000075> セロ「...I've made you feel lonely all this while, right?」

<00000093> Cero wasn't lying. I could tell that just by listening to his voice.
<00000094> 
<00000095> What a relief... that the note hadn't been lost, and had found its way to Cero.
<00000096>  Ah, since if it weren't for that, Cero wouldn't have confessed to me like this, I guess?

<00000099> v04ce1129

<00000104> v03wa1088
<00000105> ワカバ「AH, ah... haa, C-Cero...!」
<00000106> It was becoming difficult to breathe.
<00000107>  Me, and Cero... are doing something like this.
<00000108> I had never thought that this would happen... but I don't mind it at all. I'm happy.

<00000112> ワカバ「Ahn, haa, haa... haa, haaa...」
<00000113> Unable to hold myself back, I let out a cry that even I could not believe was mine.
<00000114> Cero pinched my nipples with his fingers, and toyed with them, gently moving them up and down.
<00000115> v04ce1130
<00000116> セロ「...A-are you okay?」
<00000117> That gentle movement caused an indescribable feeling to flow through my spine.
<00000118> This wasn't a shiver from the cold.
<00000119> v03wa1090
<00000120> ワカバ「This feels... good.」
<00000121> I stroked Cero's hair.

<00000124> セロ「Really? Then that's good.」
<00000125> 
<00000126> As he said that, Cero continued kissing my breast, and used his tongue to lick around my nipples.
<00000127> All the while stimulating my breast by caressing it with his hands...
<00000128> v03wa1091
<00000129> ワカバ「Haa, haa, haa... ahn.」
<00000130> My head was gradually turning blank, and I could already barely tell what was happening.
<00000131> v03wa1092
<00000132> ワカバ「...Cero, Cero, Cero!」
<00000133> Other than calling out his name as my body trembled, there was nothing else I could do.
<00000134> v04ce1132
<00000135> セロ「...Wakaba, stay still.」
<00000136> v03wa1093
<00000137> ワカバ「Eh...?」
<00000138> Unconsciously, my lower body had begun clinging tightly to Cero.
<00000139> ev050c
<00000140> v03wa1094
<00000141> ワカバ「C-Cero!」

<00000143> v04ce1133
<00000144> セロ「Amazing... your underwear is all wet.」
<00000145> He laughed softly as he said something he normally wouldn't say.
<00000146> ev050c
<00000147> v03wa1095
<00000148> ワカバ「No... don't say something like that out loud...」

<00000151> セロ「It means you feel good, right?
<00000152> Then I think it's fine.」
<00000153> He placed his finger on the surface of my underwear, and gently moved his finger up and down along in a line.
<00000154> ev050c
<00000155> v03wa1096
<00000156> ワカバ「...Nn!」
<00000157> My back suddenly arched backwards.
<00000158>  Even though he had touched it so gently... no, the reason why I was feeling this way was because he's touching me this gently.
<00000159> v03wa1097
<00000160> ワカバ「...T-this feels... good.」
<00000161> I was so embarrassed I wanted him to stop, yet, I was unable to resist. The two feelings conflicted in my mind, I tightly hugged Cero... as he pressed closer to me in turn.
<00000162> 
<00000163> v03wa1098
<00000164> ワカバ「Cero, Cero...」
<00000165> With no idea what more to do, I kept calling out his name repeatedly.
<00000166> His right hand, which had already slid below my waist, was slowly exploring the surface of my panties and kept stimulating me as he drew circles with his fingers.

<00000177> v04ce1136
<00000178> セロ「...Wakaba, you're getting so wet...」
<00000179> Cero said, his expression one of a mild surprise... It looked to me as if he was displeased.

<00000181> ワカバ「That's, that's because, because...」
<00000182> v04ce1137

<00000184> He suddenly took my hands, and guided them to his lower body.
<00000185> v04ce1138
<00000186> セロ「...Do you understand now?」
<00000187> For a moment, I didn't know what he meant, and almost asked ‘what?’, but then I realized―

<00000190> v03wa1102
<00000191> ワカバ「(―He's... so warm too...)」
<00000192> I could tell from the throbbing pulse that his feelings were gathered there... which left me at a loss for words.

<00000210> v04ce1142
<00000211> セロ「No, you too, Wakaba. ...Since, I've been in love with you for such a long time... and you never noticed, right?」
<00000212> v03wa1106
<00000213> ワカバ「...Eh, is... is that so?」
<00000214> v04ce1143
<00000215> セロ「Yup.」
<00000216> I felt a little dissatisfied that he agreed so easily.
<00000217>  So that meant, Cero had been always thinking about me, since a long time ago... right?
<00000218> v04ce1144
<00000219> セロ「Sorry. I didn't intend to blame you.」

<00000222> v03wa1107
<00000223> ワカバ「...It's okay, it's just as you said.」
<00000224> Even though I felt a little hurt by his words, that wasn't important. Since this day that I had waited for so long had finally come.
<00000225> v03wa1108
<00000226> ワカバ「...But, now that I know that... I'm not gonna ever let you go.」
<00000227> v04ce1145
<00000228> セロ「Yeah, I won't leave you either.」
<00000229> We embraced each other, and glanced around us.
<00000230> Above the wagon we'd decided to camp in was the sky, full of stars... is this what you call romantic?
<00000231> 
<00000232> black450
<00000233> v03wa1109
<00000234> ワカバ「...Thank you, Cero.」
<00000235> I gave him a light kiss on the cheek, and this time, I reached out for his crotch by myself.
<00000236> v03wa1110
<00000237> ワカバ「Even though doing this is a little embarrassing, please... accept this as my thanks.」
<00000238> Actually, I wasn't normally this bold.
<00000239> But, if it would make Cero happy... then I thought becoming a bit more bold was for the better.
<00000240> 
<00000241> ev051a
<00000242> v03wa1111
<00000243> ワカバ「Nn...」
<00000244> Wakaba was kissing my shaft.
<00000245> v04ce1146
<00000246> セロ「I-it's fine even if you don't do something like this...」
<00000247> Feeling embarrassed, I said something like that.
<00000248> v03wa1112
<00000249> ワカバ「...You don't want it?」
<00000250> She asked, her eyes gazing up at me, making me hesitate in responding.
<00000251> v04ce1147
<00000252> セロ「I-it's not that I don't want it... i-it's just I'm not prepared... for something like this.」
<00000253> v03wa1113
<00000254> ワカバ「...Cero, I'll pay you back for everything you've done for me up until now.」
<00000255> As she said that, she kissed my shaft.
<00000256> v03wa1114
<00000257> ワカバ「All my thanks, all my apologies... is it not enough?」
<00000258> v04ce1148
<00000259> セロ「I-it's not... that it's not enough...」
<00000260> Rather, I should say that I was happy. But... how did we end up in this situation?
<00000261> 
<00000262> This is the wrong way around. I should be the one who's giving thanks, not Wakaba―
<00000263> ev051b
<00000264> v03wa1115
<00000265> ワカバ「Nn... mm... Cero... you're so big.」
<00000266> Her lips quietly took my thing into her mouth, and the gentle sensation of her tongue sent waves of pleasure directly to my brain.
<00000267> 
<00000268> v04ce1149
<00000269> セロ「(―Aaah...)」
<00000270> v03wa1116
<00000271> ワカバ「Mmh... ah, you're... getting bigger again?」
<00000272> She murmured while stimulating me as if she were licking ice cream.
<00000273> v04ce1150
<00000274> セロ「S-stop...」
<00000275> Since this was my first time, the sensation was far more than I had expected, and I'd gotten excited. Honestly, even though I'd asked her to stop, in truth, I was happy.
<00000276> 
<00000277> She was showing me a face I'd never seen before, a face as if she were in a trance...
<00000278> 
<00000279> v04ce1151
<00000280> セロ「Nn...」
<00000281> Without realizing it, I'd let out a moan, this is embarrassing...
<00000282> ev051a
<00000283> v03wa1117
<00000284> ワカバ「...Ah, does it hurt?」
<00000285> Wakaba looked up to me with a puzzled expression.
<00000286> v04ce1152
<00000287> セロ「...No, it feels really good...」
<00000288> I said, while stroking her head.
<00000289> v04ce1153
<00000290> セロ「It's just that it's a little embarrassing...」
<00000291> I told her honestly how I was feeling when our eyes met. Hearing that, Wakaba laughed.
<00000292> v03wa1118
<00000293> ワカバ「...Dummy.」
<00000294> v04ce1154
<00000295> セロ「Well, maybe I am a dummy.」
<00000296> I imitated Wakaba's mannerism by knocking my own head, and sighed.
<00000297> v03wa1119
<00000298> ワカバ「If you say it like that, even I would... get embarrassed, you know?」
<00000299> she said, her eyes looking up at me from below.
<00000300> v03wa1120
<00000301> ワカバ「―If you don't like it, then I guess I'll stop...」
<00000302> she murmured with a lonely tone.
<00000303> v04ce1155
<00000304> セロ「...N-no, that's not what I meant!
<00000305> It's because... you're too cute, Wakaba...」
<00000306> 
<00000307> v03wa1121
<00000308> ワカバ「...E-ehehe. Thank you, I'll... do my best.」
<00000309> She said, continuing to grin as she started stimulating the tip of my shaft with her left hand.
<00000310> Soon, with the movements of her lips and the licking of her tongue, I gradually grew moist myself.

<00000317> v03wa1123
<00000318> ワカバ「I see... that's good...」
<00000319> We were breathing heavily due to the vigorous activity. I couldn't stop myself from reaching out for Wakaba's small breast.
<00000320> 
<00000321> v03wa1124
<00000322> ワカバ「...Ahn!」
<00000323> I felt as if they were larger than earlier.
<00000324> v04ce1157
<00000325> セロ「So soft...」
<00000326> Driven by my lust, I started caressing Wakaba's breasts.

<00000328> v03wa1125
<00000329> ワカバ「Hauu...!」
<00000330> Wakaba closed her eyes, stopped moving her mouth, and her body started trembling.
<00000331> v03wa1126
<00000332> ワカバ「Stop... not my breasts...」
<00000333> Wakaba let out a lovely voice as the pressure of my hand increased. This mutual stimulation made me all the more excited.

<00000090> The last monarch of the White Kingdom - Christina Dorn.

<00000092> \p\wBetrayed by her regent, Ein Ronberg, she lost her life to him at a young age and faded into the darkness of history... so the story goes.

<00000216> On our way back, when I was chatting with Wakaba about what we'll do over the summer break, I suddenly remembered something from long ago.
<00000217> black450
<00000218> It was back when Coco and I had just moved to Moosgrun.
<00000219> Because our new house was located far from the town center, I had decided to explore the town.
<00000220> 
<00000221> So I asked Coco to watch the house while I went out for a stroll.
<00000222> And the first place I went to was―

<00000238> セロ「O, okay. Quit pouting like that.」
<00000239> As Wakaba crossed her arms just like that time before, I held in my laughter.
<00000240> 
<00000241> black450
<00000242> Not that Wakaba had done anything.
<00000243>  ...If anything, it was my fault.

<00000250> セロ「...Ah, hello.」
<00000251> After I had entered the bakery and looked around inside, suddenly Wakaba had appeared beside me.
<00000252> I had only come in to ask where the bank and town hall were, but just when I was about to...

<00000261> 
<00000262> 
<00000263> I'd never been ‘helped’ quite so forcefully in a bakery before. I was bewildered.
<00000264> 
<00000265> st03_a01
<00000266> But, without paying any heed to me at all, she showed me five types of bread and then grinned expectantly at me.
<00000267> 
<00000268> It felt like not buying anything would be rude, so I placed one of the recommended loaves on my tray.

<00000282> ワカバ「Eh-!? Wa, wait, wait a minute!」
<00000283> 
<00000284> It seemed like she was shocked I had taken her recommendations seriously.
<00000285> Please reconsider, it's not like I'm forcing you to buy these... She even explained that to me.
<00000286> v04ce0092

<00000304> I didn't mean to tease her, but I really didn't think I would forget it.
<00000305> Since then, even though I get along with Wakaba, whenever I'm faced with her strong attitude... my conditioned reflex is to give in to her.

<00000329> v04ce0098
<00000330> セロ「Of course not.」
<00000331> I didn't remember getting a stomach ache or anything afterwards, so...

<00000342> セロ「Hm? This is...」
<00000343> 
<00000344> As I peeked inside the bag, there was a familiar paper package.
<00000345> 
<00000346> From the smell floating out from the mouth of the bag... inside it must be freshly baked bread.
<00000347> Some were even those five varieties of bread we'd talked about earlier.
<00000348> v04ce0101

<00000357> ワカバ「Ugh. Even though I'm the one who brought it for you...」

<00000405> セロ「(―Hmm. Maybe it's about her summer homework?)」
<00000406> Usually it's me asking favors of Wakaba. I'd never considered that she might have a request of me.

<00000419> ワカバ「Well, we'll talk about that when we reach your place, okay?」
<00000420> Wakaba thumped her fist against her bag, and laughed in satisfaction.
<00000421> st03_a05
<00000422> ...Then, just as I thought she might return to her serious expression...
<00000423> st03_a07

<00000437> If she only thought a bit more about the consequences of her actions, she'd be a good girl.
<00000438> black450
<00000439> But that part of her is what makes her Wakaba... When I thought of it like that, I wasn't bothered by it.

<00000459> Though I've gotten used to living together with Coco, I still wasn't very good at taking care of the house.
<00000460> 
<00000461> When my father was still around, I should have helped him out and not left everything to him, but I guess it's too late now.
<00000462> v04ce0118
<00000463> セロ「Is it around here?」
<00000464> When I was in the kitchen earlier, I'd felt a drop of water from a leak.
<00000465> There had been a rainstorm the day before yesterday. I hadn't considered if it might have damaged the roof.

<00000467> v04ce0119
<00000468> セロ「But I never thought that the preparations alone would take so much time...」
<00000469> I had looked up at the roof, consulted my book on do-it-yourself carpentry, and went to fetch the ladder and other necessities from that shed I rarely entered.
<00000470> 
<00000471> ...Before I knew it, half an hour had already passed.

<00000483> セロ「Oopsy... daisy...」
<00000484> As I lifted the piece of pottery tile, I found the underside was moist. The leak had saturated the nearby area.

<00000494> If an indoor person like me were to try fixing something like this, it wouldn't end well.
<00000495> \p\wWhat's more, if Coco saw me climbing up to the roof with a ladder―
<00000496> st04_c03
<00000497> v04ce0125
<00000498> セロ「...She'd definitely want to climb up too.」
<00000499> That was what worried me the most.
<00000500> After all, Coco loves to climb to high places and look out into the distance.
<00000501> But often, she can't climb back down on her own and needs my help.
<00000502> I've lost count of how many times I've had to rescue Coco as she wails from a high treetop.

<00000511> セロ「(―But if she called my name, that must mean that she saw me.)」
<00000512> As I was wondering what to do, I saw a figure following behind Coco, made unmistakable by the triangular headscarf that fluttered in the wind.

<00000566> After barging into my house, without even giving me time to put the tea on, Wakaba had dragged me into my room.
<00000567> And then she took out something like a manuscript from her bag and thrust it into my hand.
<00000568> 
<00000569> ...Judging from the sparkle in her eyes, she seemed to be rather proud of it.

<00000612> History is just the dregs of the past. Only those who were alive at that time can know the truth.
<00000613> If future generations want to learn about the past, they can only do so through what we've written down and told to our children.

<00000713> 
<00000714> Due in part to the failure of his plan, he assassinated his charge, Princess Christina.
<00000715> 
<00000716> 
<00000717> But he was captured by the united armies of the Red and Blue Kingdoms, led by a doll trained by the princess while she was still alive. ...That is what history says.

<00000093> Of course, Rein's generosity makes me happy.

<00000101> People who have the knowledge and skill to create a Sister like this are known as ‘doll engineers’.
<00000102> 
<00000103> 
<00000104> 
<00000105> And among them, Rein is the most knowledgeable of all ― he is considered to be a ‘national treasure’.

<00000110> セロ「(―My father never told me anything about her, after all.)」
<00000111> When my father first brought Coco home, I was just barely old enough to understand other people's conversations.
<00000112> 
<00000113> That's why, to me, Coco was a playmate and a big sister.
<00000114> She was part of our family, not something I felt curious to know the origin of.
<00000115> 
<00000116>

<00000130> Sisters, older sisters, younger sisters... even though they're all called Sisters, they are still a great mystery.
<00000131> 
<00000132> There are Sisters that you can barely tell apart from real humans, and others like Coco, who are obviously Sisters.
<00000133> 
<00000134> 
<00000135> 
<00000136> 
<00000137> They only have one thing in common- ‘Drop.’ Also known as doll's stone, it's the crystal that provides energy for the Sisters.
<00000138> 
<00000139> \p\wThere aren't many Sisters left nowadays... but in the past, many artisans competed to make them.
<00000140> 
<00000141> 
<00000142> ...That being said, creating one from scratch takes an immense amount of labor and money, so the Sisters of many different levels of quality exist.

<00000026> When we were staying in La Renoncule, I had some things on my mind.
<00000027> That's because this trip was originally planned to be just Cero, Coco and me.
<00000028> v03wa0400
<00000029> ワカバ「(―There's no way we can all sleep in one room.)」
<00000030> But Cero was unexpectedly thoughtful; he'd already booked two rooms before our departure.

<00000032> ワカバ「(―Thanks to that, adding Light isn't that big of a deal.)」
<00000033> It had still ruined my fantasy quite nicely. But even if I couldn't hang out alone with Cero like I had hoped, sleeping in the room next to his... was a little exciting.

<00000060> He's never once been ‘a good boy’ up until now, so how can anyone trust him?

<00000069> ワカバ「(―A-ah. How did my brother end up like this?)」
<00000070> When he was little, he used to call me ‘Big Sis, Big Sis’ so politely, and listen to me obediently.

<00000072> v03wa0407
<00000073> ワカバ「(―He was so cute back then.)」
<00000074> Since then, he's grown to be more and more of a brat. Whenever Light did something wrong, I got punished too, but if I tried to use that to discipline him―

<00000084> The worst part of all is that when I take him on seriously, he can handle me without breaking a sweat.
<00000085> That pisses me off the most.
<00000086> v03wa0409
<00000087> ワカバ「(―Why? I was the one who stood up for you when you used to wet your bed.)」

<00000206> According to the map that he showed me before we started walking, Mr. Rein's house is located far away from the residential area.

<00000012> v04ce0567
<00000013> セロ「...Okay.」
<00000014> After finishing our late lunch, I'd come to Rein's room.
<00000015> Everyone else was resting after their meal, passing time in their own way.

<00000023> v11re0068
<00000024> レイン「Hm, you mean the interview? I actually found it rather pleasant. Recently, even if I reminisce about the past, there has been no one to talk about it with.」
<00000025> 
<00000026> 
<00000027> Rein said as he leaned back in the chair.
<00000028> st11_a04

<00000030> レイン「...Also, lunch was excellent.」

<00000034> セロ「Ahaha, it was indeed.」
<00000035> The weather was unusually nice today, so we had our lunch out in the open.
<00000036> bg07a01
<00000037> Wakaba and I arranged the cutlery, and put a tablecloth over the round wooden table on the porch.
<00000038> 
<00000039> After that, we gathered together and Belle fetched Rein from his room.
<00000040> Even though Light had only made simple dishes like curry and ham sandwiches, there were many dishes to choose from, so it was rather well received.
<00000041> 
<00000042> 
<00000043> It's just that, as Wakaba was trying the curry,
<00000044> st03_a00
<00000045> v03wa0567
<00000046> ワカバ「Well, doesn't this taste fine?」
<00000047> she had said while staring me with a mysterious glare.
<00000048> black450
<00000049> She must have remembered the white curry incident from the past.

<00000059> v04ce0571
<00000060> セロ「Eh, yeah...」
<00000061> At a loss how to explain the complicated life I was living at the moment, I felt troubled.

<00000063> st11_a02
<00000064> v11re0072

<00000073> v04ce0573
<00000074> セロ「I wouldn't have said uncertain, but... Yes, I guess I am a bit uncertain.」
<00000075> v11re0074
<00000076> レイン「Hoho. Is it because of Coco?」
<00000077> v04ce0574
<00000078> セロ「Eh!?」
<00000079> The way he had seen through me in an instant gave me a shock.

<00000084> セロ「A guess, huh?」
<00000085> v11re0076
<00000086> レイン「...Well, only half a guess. Hohoho.」
<00000087> Rein laughed heartily, and asked,
<00000088> st11_a02
<00000089> v11re0077
<00000090> レイン「So, how is Coco worrying you?」
<00000091>  in a kind voice.
<00000092> v04ce0576
<00000093> セロ「...It's a bit difficult to say...」
<00000094> Would it be unwise to learn a bit about doll engineering before I become a true historian?
<00000095> 
<00000096> I quickly recounted to Rein the discussion I'd had with Wakaba before coming here.
<00000097> 
<00000098> st11_a07
<00000099> v11re0078
<00000100> レイン「Hm, it's certainly a concern befitting a serious-minded young fellow like you.」
<00000101> v04ce0577
<00000102> セロ「My apologies.」
<00000103> st11_a04
<00000104> v11re0079
<00000105> レイン「No, no. I don't mean to trivialize your concern. On the contrary, I'm happy to hear it, since it's true I have no successor.」
<00000106> 
<00000107> st11_a07
<00000108> v11re0080
<00000109> レイン「―Though personally, I would hope that you'd learn doll engineering first...」
<00000110>

<00000113> st11_a02
<00000114> v11re0081
<00000115> レイン「To continue in the field of history, or become a doll engineer instead... You'll have to decide which path to take, just like I did.」
<00000116> 
<00000117> v11re0082
<00000118> レイン「―Before you seek your answer to this dilemma, there is a favor I was thinking of asking of you.」
<00000119> 
<00000120> v04ce0579
<00000121> セロ「What is it? If it's a favor to you, Rein, I'd be happy to...」
<00000122> 
<00000123> st11_a01
<00000124> v11re0083
<00000125> レイン「Hohoho. Rather than a favor to me, it's more like a favor to Wakaba.」
<00000126> v04ce0580
<00000127> セロ「To Wakaba?」
<00000128> v11re0084
<00000129> レイン「That's right, your friend Wakaba. She's a pretty interesting girl.」
<00000130> st11_a00
<00000131> v11re0085
<00000132> レイン「―She wants to become a novelist no matter what, right?」
<00000133> v04ce0581
<00000134> セロ「Yeah.」
<00000135> st11_a02
<00000136> v11re0086
<00000137> レイン「From your point of view, what do you think? Can she become a novelist?」
<00000138> 
<00000139> 「...That depends on how much effort she puts into it.」
<00000140> 「...It's Wakaba. I'm sure she can do it.」
<00000141> v04ce0582
<00000142> セロ「...It's Wakaba. I'm sure she can do it.」
<00000143> Even though I'm perhaps biased because Wakaba is my friend, I truly believe she has the potential to achieve her dreams.
<00000144> 
<00000145> st11_a04
<00000146> v11re0087
<00000147> レイン「Indeed, no? Wakaba is a child who can do anything, just like you. ...even I seem to have that impression.」
<00000148> 
<00000149> v04ce0583
<00000150> セロ「...That depends on how much effort she puts into it.」
<00000151> Nothing is easy from the start - that's a fact for any kind of endeavor.
<00000152> But as long as you don't lose your passion and keep working hard, there will always be a way.
<00000153> st11_a00
<00000154> v11re0088
<00000155> レイン「Mmm. Perhaps it's a bit harsh, I've decided to test Wakaba.」
<00000156> 
<00000157> v04ce0584
<00000158> セロ「...Eh?」
<00000159> I forced a smile as a feeling of anxiety overcame me.
<00000160>  What in the world did Wakaba say to Rein...
<00000161> st11_a02
<00000162> v11re0089
<00000163> レイン「In two months time, there is going to be a theater festival in Moosgrun, right?」
<00000164> v04ce0585
<00000165> セロ「Ah, yes... wait, you mean...!?」
<00000166> So Wakaba had told him about her brash entry to the theater festival that she'd told me on the way here from La Renoncule.
<00000167> 
<00000168> v11re0090
<00000169> レイン「Yes. I'm sure you are already aware, but Wakaba wishes to prove herself at the theater festival.」
<00000170> v04ce0586
<00000171> セロ「I do know that... but have you heard the details?」
<00000172> st11_a05
<00000173> v11re0091
<00000174> レイン「Ah, the script is unfinished, and the actors have not been chosen yet.」
<00000175> v04ce0587
<00000176> セロ「Th, that's right. But...」
<00000177> st11_a04
<00000178> v11re0092
<00000179> レイン「In addition, the play she's writing is based on the hidden truth of ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ audaciously portraying the betrayer, Ein, as a good person... What an unexpected twist.」
<00000180> 
<00000181> 
<00000182> It seems that Wakaba had told him everything.
<00000183> v04ce0588
<00000184> セロ「So, the favor Wakaba asked of you was...」
<00000185> st11_a05
<00000186> v11re0093
<00000187> レイン「In short, she requested that I financially sponsor her. That's what we spoke about interview before lunch, after you left the room.」
<00000188> 
<00000189> v04ce0589
<00000190> セロ「...As I thought...」
<00000191> It was only to be expected of her, but should I think of it as unreasonable, or just too tactless?
<00000192>  It's so like Wakaba to take such a bold approach after making her decision.
<00000193> v04ce0590
<00000194> セロ「So, did you agree to it?」
<00000195> st11_a01
<00000196> v11re0094
<00000197> レイン「...I gave her a few conditions.」
<00000198> Rein glanced at me with his narrowed eyes, and nodded a few times.
<00000199> st11_a00
<00000200> v11re0095
<00000201> レイン「First, I asked Wakaba to find the actors herself.」
<00000202> v11re0096
<00000203> レイン「―When I said that, she immediately suggested my daughter as a candidate.」
<00000204> v04ce0591
<00000205> セロ「Belle?」
<00000206> v11re0097
<00000207> レイン「To play the role of the Sister in The Angel's Guidance.」
<00000208> 
<00000209> 
<00000210> st11_a04
<00000211> v11re0098
<00000212> レイン「―That's what she said. I was personally fine with it, but who knows how Belle will feel? ‘If you want my daughter to perform, ask her yourself.’ ...That's what I said.」
<00000213> 
<00000214> v04ce0592
<00000215> セロ「So that's the reason...」
<00000216> That's why Wakaba was in such a hurry to talk to Belle on the porch earlier.
<00000217> v04ce0593
<00000218> セロ「...Huh, Rein? That wasn't the only condition for your sponsorship, was it?」
<00000219> 
<00000220> 
<00000221> st11_a00
<00000222> v11re0099
<00000223> レイン「Ah, there are other conditions I haven't spoken of yet. That's why I called you here. ...So that you can tell her about them later.」
<00000224> 
<00000225> v04ce0594
<00000226> セロ「I don't mind, but...」
<00000227> st11_a01
<00000228> v11re0100
<00000229> レイン「Relax. They're not anything too difficult, so calm down.」
<00000230> Rein sat up straight on his chair, and looked me in the eye once again.
<00000231> st11_a02
<00000232> v11re0101
<00000233> レイン「What I heard from Wakaba was that her script is not actually an adaptation of ‘The Angel's Guidance,’ but rather something she wishes to remain true to history.」
<00000234> 
<00000235> 
<00000236> v11re0102
<00000237> レイン「―If that's the case, she needs suitable evidence to prove Ein's innocence, right?」
<00000238> v04ce0595
<00000239> セロ「That's true.」
<00000240> st11_a00
<00000241> v11re0103
<00000242> レイン「So that's why, as Wakaba is researching what happened in the past, she'll need an assistant.」
<00000243> 
<00000244> v04ce0596
<00000245> セロ「...And that will be me?」
<00000246> Even though I knew the answer, I still asked to be sure.
<00000247> st11_a01
<00000248> v11re0104
<00000249> レイン「Well, even if I don't specify so, it should be obvious. Hohoho.」

<00000251> v04ce0597
<00000252> セロ「(―Whoa, the way he laughs is as if it were someone else's business.)」
<00000253> st11_a00
<00000254> v11re0105
<00000255> レイン「I have two more conditions. The first one is to travel to the location where the story began, Weiss― and see for yourself the White City and the Castle of Dornstein.」
<00000256> st11_a05
<00000257> v11re0106
<00000258> レイン「―The second condition is to gather all the actors yourselves. If you fulfill these conditions, I'll sponsor the performance. Is that within your means?」
<00000259> 
<00000260> v04ce0598
<00000261> セロ「...How should I say it?」
<00000262> Visiting the actual setting, and gathering the actors ourselves.
<00000263>  These are sensible enough conditions that Rein needn't have set in stone, but the latter might not be so easy.
<00000264> Even though the theater festival has no rules concerning whether the actors are amateurs or professionals, those who have performed recently have set quite a high standard.
<00000265> If all the actors we gather are all amateurs, and we put them into Wakaba's problematic scenario...
<00000266>  Then we can probably expect our performance to be roundly panned.
<00000267> Still...
<00000268> v04ce0599
<00000269> セロ「...Anyway, we won't know until we try.」
<00000270> st11_a01
<00000271> v11re0107
<00000272> レイン「Splendid, splendid. That's a good attitude. Young people should always take on new challenges.」

<00000303> After considering it for a while, I couldn't find any reason to object.
<00000304> Even for me, traveling to a place I've never been before like the White City is quite a temptation.

<00000453> I couldn't read Belle's expression. I didn't know what to do next.
<00000454> But there had been a one-liner like this in a novel I'd read in the past, and it had worked!

<00000482>

<00000504> The appearance of the Sister in The Angel's Guidance 
<00000505> 
<00000506> has been widely speculated about, but no one can say for sure how she really looked.
<00000507> But, the image of the ‘angel’ that I'm imagining 
<00000508> 
<00000509> is that of an antique doll with wings.

<00000574> Right now I'd just like her to promise to join the troupe. I'll explain the details to her later.

<00000593>  and she replied, making my shoulders drop.
<00000594> 
<00000595> For a moment, I almost blurted out a question like ‘why not?’, but I knew that would be counterproductive, so I kept it to myself.
<00000596> 
<00000597> Just as Cero had said on the train, it's difficult for people to accept things so hastily.

<00000641> It's not like I'm uninterested.
<00000642>  In addition, Wakaba had said she needed me no matter what when she invited me, which made me truly happy.
<00000643> ...But after telling me what I would actually do, I could hardly imagine it.

<00000109>  I think that's the best solution.
<00000110> But if Belle wants a room to herself, we'll have to change the arrangement we set up back in La Renoncule.
<00000111>  So it'll be a total of three rooms: Coco with me, Light together with Wakaba, and Belle on her own.

<00000577> ベル「I'm truly grateful. Thank you very much.」
<00000578> After thanking the engineer several times and closing the door, I started down the apartment's stoop.
<00000579> 
<00000580> Inside this basket, there was about to be a long-awaited reunion between friends.

<00000583> I wanted to hear everybody's ‘Time to wake up’ song right away, I'll let Choco perform it for me right now―

<00000588> So, tonight... No, we'll do it tomorrow morning.
<00000589>  So until then, I'll be patient.
<00000590> st01_d06
<00000591> v01be0216
<00000592> ベル「...Looks like Wakaba isn't here yet.」
<00000593> I looked around the entrance of the apartment we had promised to meet at, but I couldn't see her.
<00000594> 
<00000595> I had spent about thirty minutes with the engineer, which means I'll be waiting for another hour.
<00000596> 
<00000597> st01_d00
<00000598> v01be0217
<00000599> ベル「(―I thought it would take much longer...)」
<00000600> The engineer who was doing Choco's maintenance was an unexpectedly quiet person, so I only had to answer a few questions about my father.
<00000601> 
<00000602> I had figured that he'd have a lot more questions, so it was a relief that it didn't turn out that way.
<00000603> st01_d03
<00000604> v01be0218
<00000605> ベル「...What should I do? There's still quite some time left.」
<00000606> 
<00000607> Should I just wait here for Wakaba?
<00000608>  Or should I go for a stroll on the nearby streets?
<00000609> Either way, I wanted to do some sightseeing.
<00000610> st01_d00
<00000611> v01be0219
<00000612> ベル「...But I must be sure to pay attention, so I'm not late for the meet-up.」
<00000613> To make sure I wouldn't get lost, I memorized the area around me carefully and headed out into the street, avoiding the narrow alleys.
<00000614> 
<00000615> It's possible that I might even bump into Wakaba.
<00000616> st01_d06
<00000617> v01be0220
<00000618> ベル「...What a lovely street.」
<00000619> Since coming to the Blue Capital, I've noticed that all the buildings here are a lot bigger than those in Silberg.
<00000620> Because of the buildings' height, as I looked up... I could only see a small sliver of the sky.
<00000621> st01_d04
<00000622> v01be0221
<00000623> ベル「Compared to this, isn't Silberg just a village?」
<00000624> Even though I've never yearned to live in the big city, I don't hate streets like these either... Still, I think I like places surrounded by nature much more.
<00000625> 
<00000626> st01_d06
<00000627> v01be0222
<00000628> ベル「...As the saying goes, ‘There's no place like home.’」
<00000629> I'm sure, from the perspective of the people who live here, that this city is the perfect home.
<00000630> People from elsewhere, even if they wanted to visit Silberg to see the scenery, would probably never think of moving there.
<00000631> 
<00000632> st01_d05
<00000633> v01be0223
<00000634> ベル「Ah! I should go buy some souvenirs for Father, shouldn't I?」
<00000635> 
<00000636> In that case, I'll have to leave the residential area, and head for the market district.
<00000637> But I probably don't have enough time to go there and back.
<00000638> st01_d00
<00000639> v01be0224
<00000640> ベル「(―I'll do that after meeting with everyone.)」
<00000641> That way, I'll know where the hotel is, which means I can go anywhere I want.
<00000642> If it's already dark by then, then I'll look around tomorrow.
<00000643> st01_d03
<00000644> v01be0225
<00000645> ベル「(―Tomorrow...)」
<00000646> I stopped in my tracks.
<00000647>  ...When tomorrow comes, what should I do?
<00000648> Wakaba and her friends' lonely faces suddenly appeared in my mind.
<00000649> I had finished my business in the Blue Capital, so I no longer have a reason to stay here.
<00000650> Wakaba won't remain here either. Her group will continue their journey, and head to their next destination― the White Capital.
<00000651> As things are, I'll be going back to Silberg by myself.
<00000652> st01_d07
<00000653> v01be0226
<00000654> ベル「(―What to do? What should I do?)」
<00000655> 
<00000656> I really want to travel with them for a little longer.
<00000657> But, for that to happen... I have to accept Wakaba's invitation.
<00000658> st01_d03
<00000659> v01be0227
<00000660> ベル「...I don't know what to do.」
<00000661> If it's Wakaba, even if I don't participate in the play and just help out behind the stage, she'll probably still welcome me into her group.
<00000662> 
<00000663> But, I don't want to do that.
<00000664> Because Wakaba wishes for me to stand on the stage, I want to do what I can to fulfill that wish.
<00000665> That's why I would have no choice but to sing in front of an audience.
<00000666> 
<00000667> st01_d07
<00000668> v01be0228
<00000669> ベル「(―That would be impossible for me as I am now.)」
<00000670> No matter what kind of song it is, I can only sing when I'm alone.
<00000671> ...In front of people, I'm too shy to even make a peep.
<00000672> st01_d03
<00000673> v01be0229
<00000674> ベル「...What can I do so that I can sing?」
<00000675> As I looked at my basket, I sighed.
<00000676> v01be0230
<00000677> ベル「(―In front of my friends in here, I would be fine.)」
<00000678> If these children are the only audience, then everything would be fine... As I thought of that, I realized a bigger problem.
<00000679> 
<00000680> No matter how I think of it, the other actors would be able to hear me anyway.
<00000681> st01_d07
<00000682> v01be0231
<00000683> ベル「...I can't do it.」
<00000684> I didn't want to lie to Wakaba and her friends by telling them ‘I can do it.’
<00000685>  In order not to trouble them, I should let them find someone else.
<00000686> st01_d03
<00000687> v01be0232
<00000688> ベル「(―I'm sorry, Wakaba.)」
<00000689> When we meet later, I'll reject her invitation and tell her my reason.

<00000694> Faced with Wakaba, ever so optimistic... could I tell her?
<00000695>  As I thought of that, my chest hurt.

<00000009> I declared over to the woman behind me― the store manager.

<00000015> アンジ「You're welcome! I'll be going now!」
<00000016> 
<00000017> I passed the meat tenderizer to her, swiftly shed my apron and cap, and changed back into my casual clothes.
<00000018> 
<00000019> Even though they always tease me for always being in such a rush to go home, I can't afford to waste any time!

<00000048> v00an0032
<00000049> アンジ「(―Thank you for always taking care of me.)」
<00000050> I thanked her in my heart once more.
<00000051> When I told her that I wanted to go to theater rehearsals, not only did she grant my selfish request by giving me flexible working hours, 
<00000052> 
<00000053> she even told me I could take home leftover meat when it still could have been sold.
<00000054> st00_d00

<00000056> アンジ「(―So many people have supported me.)」
<00000057> For the sake of standing on stage, I musn't forget these feelings... It's because I hold them in my heart that I can continue to give it my all.
<00000058> 
<00000059> And the result of my efforts will be announced tomorrow morning.

<00000065> As long as I listen to the acting pointers they give me, I shouldn't have any problems becoming the final candidate.

<00000070> 
<00000071> Hasn't Paula asked me to buy a few too many groceries?
<00000072> 
<00000073> ...It would be a waste if they had to be thrown away because we couldn't finish them before they went bad. I guess I'll go get canned ones instead.

<00000087> アンジ「Eh, really? Thank you!」
<00000088> 
<00000089> I continued shopping on these familiar streets, collecting the groceries on the list one by one.
<00000090> 
<00000091> I haven't had so much fun shopping in a long time. Soon, my hands were full.

<00000099> v00an0040
<00000100> アンジ「Hmm...」
<00000101> I guess I'll play with my siblings in the courtyard again?
<00000102> Well, doing that once in a while is fine too. Just as I started heading down the route to home, with that thought―

<00000115> 
<00000116> black450
<00000117> I walked down the large avenue opposite the market, taking the long way.
<00000118> bg10d01
<00000119> There's a fountain at the corner of this residential street. It's a place that I like a lot.
<00000120> Even though it's a recreational area, not many people use it.
<00000121> st00_d00
<00000122> I discovered this place about a year ago.
<00000123> ―The area isn't too wide or too narrow.
<00000124> There's enough space to pretend it's a stage, and the walls surrounding the area have good acoustics.
<00000125> 
<00000126> At first, my voice was too loud and caused a disturbance for the people living nearby.
<00000127> But since, I've learned to control my voice and recite my lines at a less conspicuous volume.
<00000128> 
<00000129> Of course, if there's anyone else around, I'll just recite and review my lines silently so I don't disturb them.
<00000130> st00_d06
<00000131> v00an0044
<00000132> アンジ「...So, what should I do today?」
<00000133> Should I rehearse my final scene in preparation for the third audition?
<00000134> black450
<00000135> I wondered that as I turned the corner, and as I was about to enter the courtyard―
<00000136> sv001a
<00000137> v00an0045
<00000138> アンジ「(―There's someone here?)」
<00000139> Noticing a presence, I came to a halt.
<00000140> v00an0046
<00000141> アンジ「(―Is it the same lady who's usually here?)」
<00000142> If it's the woman who always sits by the corner, I could just bid her a good afternoon.
<00000143> 
<00000144> But if it's someone else... I didn't bring my script, so I guess I'll stop after practicing whatever lines I can remember off the top of my head.
<00000145> 
<00000146> With that decided, I took a step forward.
<00000147> black450
<00000148> But when I saw it wasn't who I expected, I stopped where I stood.

<00000153> ベル「...Ah-. Ah-, Ah-」
<00000154> The girl stared at the sky as she arched her back. Was she practicing singing?
<00000155> Her clothes were as white as snow, matching the wing decoration on her back.
<00000156> 
<00000157> v00an0047
<00000158> アンジ「(―She's so pretty...)」
<00000159> She reminded me of a drawing of a fairy I'd seen once.
<00000160> The wind passing between the buildings lightly tousled her wavy blond hair.
<00000161> v01be0234
<00000162> ベル「...Ah-, Ah-. Is that enough?」
<00000163> The hand upon her throat slowly slid downwards and spread itself out.
<00000164> It seems like she hadn't noticed me yet.
<00000165> Whereas I couldn't move forward, nor back... but only stare at the sight of her.
<00000166> The girl stepped forward.
<00000167> v01be0235
<00000168> ベル「...La la la la la...」
<00000169> In her clear voice, she began to sing out a beautiful melody.

<00000172> アンジ「(―What a lovely voice...)」
<00000173> I've never heard this song before, but it hardly matters.
<00000174> 
<00000175> I can't do anything but stand still and listen.
<00000176> Belatedly, yet naturally... her melody found words.
<00000177> v00an0049
<00000178> アンジ「(―Gazing at the sky, promised to the birds...)」
<00000179> If I had known that song, I wouldn't just have stood there and repeated her lyrics in my head. I would surely have sung along beside her.
<00000180> 
<00000181> ...That's how her voice made me feel, as it echoed inside my heart.
<00000182> v01be0236

<00000194> With that, her song came to an end.
<00000195>  A pang of regret shot through me, and I stepped forward without thinking―
<00000196> black450
<00000197> v00an0053
<00000198> アンジ「...Ah!」
<00000199> I regained my senses as a can fell from my bag, and I reached out to grab it!

<00000201> v00an0054
<00000202> アンジ「...Phew.」
<00000203>  And barely did.
<00000204> That was dangerous. She would definitely have heard the can clattering on the ground.
<00000205> v00an0055
<00000206> アンジ「(―Ah, but... didn't I shout quite loudly just now?)」
<00000207> I nervously raised my head, intending to apologize for surprising her.
<00000208> But the figure of the white fairy had vanished, leaving the peaceful courtyard as empty as usual.
<00000209> black450

<00000215> Was that girl just now― an illusion?
<00000216> No, that can't be.

<00000231> Because it'd taken so long to settle things at the hotel, it was almost past the meeting time already, so I'd let Coco and Light go on ahead.
<00000232> 
<00000233> By the time I catch up, I'll probably miss our arranged meeting time of five o'clock.

<00000235> セロ「(―Who could have known something like this would happen?)」
<00000236> Just when we thought we'd found two suitable rooms so quickly, we ran into a problem registering, because Coco and Belle are Sisters.
<00000237> 
<00000238> 
<00000239> 
<00000240> The seedy-looking hotel manager had said that because the Blue Capital greatly respects Sisters, it has special regulations regarding them.
<00000241> 
<00000242> 
<00000243> 
<00000244> We'd never even heard of something like that in La Renoncule or Pervenche, but even though we were puzzled, we followed the instructions and filled out the registration documents.
<00000245> 
<00000246> 
<00000247> ...It's just that when we'd reached the personal identification part, we called Rein's number, and all our problems ended up solved in an instant.
<00000248> 
<00000249> After the hotel manager had asked to speak to the person on the other end―
<00000250> He told us not to worry about the price, and said that we'd be getting the finest rooms.
<00000251> 
<00000252> v04ce0720

<00000254> 
<00000255> 
<00000256> When I realized that, I somehow didn't feel right accepting the offer.
<00000257> Even though I felt bad for not discussing it with Wakaba and the others first, I had only booked the rooms temporarily, telling the manager we only wanted to stay one night.

<00000764> The true passage of time is equal for all, but how long those minutes feel is different for everyone...
<00000765> 
<00000766> Does that apply to Sisters too?
<00000767> 
<00000768> 
<00000769> If the Drops that power us are different, maybe we Sisters feel things differently too.
<00000770> 
<00000771> 
<00000772> Or is it due to the combination of our bodies and the Drops?
<00000773> 
<00000774> 
<00000775> Or could my sense of time be altered by my experiences and memories?

<00000146> Based on the directions, it's about the same route as the open terrace I'm headed to.
<00000147> After asking her whether she wrote them down―
<00000148> ‘After going to the main street, turn right and then left and you should see the sign board.’ ...She's planning on following these vague directions.

<00000157> I'll explain the rest of directions to her after that... that should do it.
<00000158> If she got lost due to my carelessness, it would just cause more trouble having to search for her.

<00000265> 
<00000266> As I watched Wakaba cheerily take out her wallet, I also reached into the pocket of my skirt.
<00000267> 
<00000268> She had invited me, but I had promised to treat her today.
<00000269> So, I'd brought more money than usual.

<00000291> If I borrow some money from Wakaba, it would solve this crisis.

<00000321> v00an0234
<00000322> アンジ「O, okay. Thank you...」

<00000541> v00an0243
<00000542> アンジ「...Ah...」
<00000543> Upon the ring finger of her left hand, there was a simple yet shining ring.

<00000579> After putting on many successful performances, she slowly built up a reputation, and is now quite a famous actress.
<00000580> 
<00000581> Occasionally, I saw her on television giving an interview, but being in front of the actual person―

<00000602> Mischievously, my mentor repeated the question that she had asked earlier.

<00000680> Back then, mom said it was an ‘investment in my future’ and made me enroll in the school.
<00000681> After entering, I found out that everyone was better than me, even though we were in the same class. I was frantic to catch up.
<00000682> v08ma0029

<00000692> マリオ「―Well, of course, anyone would be tempted by the bigger ones.」
<00000693> v08ma0033
<00000694> マリオ「But if you had one chance and didn't succeed, and gave up because of it, don't you think that would be a waste?」

<00000697> v08ma0034
<00000698> マリオ「You know, I hope that bit by bit you can catch up with me.」
<00000699> I digested her words, one at a time.
<00000700> I knew that I couldn't aim for the sky if I didn't have solid ground under my feet. I knew that two years ago.
<00000701> But right now, as I tried to rebuild my confidence, shattered by the audition results―

<00000858> As everyone was focused on practicing earnestly, I noticed one girl who stood out.
<00000859> Even though that child was practicing just as diligently, there was something different about her.

<00000244> It's not like I had meant to scold Wakaba.

<00000253> Wakaba had already left, her shoulders drooping. She's probably heading back to her own room.

<00000313> It's possible that they'll come out from the dining hall after they finish talking, so I decided not to go to my room and instead went back outside.
<00000314> 
<00000315> I'll breathe in the fresh air once more, then listen to what Belle has to say.

<00000331> ベル「Ever since Wakaba invited me, I've been thinking. Whether to accept, or to refuse.」

<00000333> v01be0374
<00000334> ベル「Miss Angelina, which do you think I should choose?」

<00000337> v00an0364
<00000338> アンジ「...Sorry to disappoint you, but I feel that something like this should be decided by yourself.」

<00000357> v00an0368
<00000358> アンジ「...Then what if the person who heard you sang before said that she wanted to hear it again?」

<00000367> v01be0379
<00000368> ベル「...Yes. If that person thinks my song is good enough.」

<00000007> Last night, I was abruptly woken up by Wakaba, who had wanted to talk to me about her quarrel with Angelina.
<00000008> 
<00000009> From there, the conversation evolved into us discussing what she could do to make up to Angelina.
<00000010> We stayed in the dining hall, talking, until Nicola came by and saw us. By the time we made it back to our room, it was already light out.

<00000011> 
<00000012> These clothes were all rental costumes chosen based on the information Cero had gathered in the library.
<00000013> 
<00000014> According to Cero, in the historical play ‘The Angel's Guidance’, each character is traditionally associated with a color of their own.
<00000015> 
<00000016> For example, Princess Christina's color is white.
<00000017> Whereas the traitor, Ein, wears the opposite color- black. Cero had told me this was so the audience could identify the characters easily.

<00000060> ベル「(―I wonder what my costume looks like?)」
<00000061> The costume of the most popular angel in ‘The Angel's Guidance’ ―the Schwester.
<00000062> 
<00000063> The scarf that was to wrap around my neck and the wing on my back was black in color.
<00000064> st01_e00
<00000065> It had the same shape as the scarf I always wore... did Wakaba choose it because of that?
<00000066> 
<00000067> The costume fits me perfectly too, that's quite admirable.
<00000068> After looking myself over in the mirror, I left the dressing room, descended from the stage, and headed for the audience seating.

<00000078> Even though the story of our plays was different, Efa and I had surpassed the barrier of time, and we were both playing the same role of the ‘Angel’.

<00000093> Faced with her smile and her words of praise, my face had turned red before I knew it, and as I was about to bow my head to hide my embarrassment―

<00000108> アンジ「That's right, just like that. ...Look, someone else is back.」

<00000132> Angelina nodded silently in agreement with my answer.
<00000133> 
<00000134> But, even though we had praised Silvia, she still kept on adjusting her hem and sleeves, as if concerned with their fit.

<00000142> 
<00000143> Even though she said that flippantly, I knew those were her true thoughts.
<00000144> ...That's because it was rare of Angelina to compliment others.

<00000146> v06si0462
<00000147> シルヴ「Well, I do think knights are pretty cool, though...」
<00000148> She scratched her head, and grinned as if she appreciated the flattery.
<00000149>  But, she seemed to be quite concerned about the prop she was holding in her hand.

<00000169> With a hopeless expression on her face, Ange looked towards the ceiling, leaving the task of persuading Silvia upon my shoulders.

<00000186> アンジ「Dear me, can you really succeed in the role of the knight like that?」
<00000187> Angelina sighed, and just as Silvia was about to retort, the sound of metal clanging came from across the stage.
<00000188> 
<00000189> 
<00000190> As the three of us turned to look at the source of that sound, we found it was―

<00000196> It was Light, wearing a helmet.

<00000199> アンジ「Well don't you make a cute little soldier.」
<00000200> As they both patted the top of his helmet, Light came and stood in front of me,

<00000202> v05li0737
<00000203> ライト「So, does it suit me?!」
<00000204>  and asked.
<00000205> v01be0621
<00000206> ベル「...It does, you look really tough.」
<00000207> Even though he did make a rather small soldier, in truth Light is a boy who's very dependable when the time comes. I understood that well.

<00000210> v05li0738
<00000211> ライト「Ehehe.」
<00000212> Light smiled happily as he stood side by side with us. 
<00000213> And then, the final person to appear was Cero, who didn't look like himself at all―
<00000214> st04_b06
<00000215> If I had to describe how he looked with a mustache... honestly, I couldn't find the words.

<00000218> アンジ「...W-well, now that everyone is here... how about we practice for a while on stage?」
<00000219>

<00000268> Well, it's my first time here, after all.
<00000269> I had wanted to come and visit this place a few times in the past, since I was interested in the theater festival back then, but had forgotten all about it.
<00000270>

<00000326> ...But soon enough, I found that Cero actually meant ‘are you coming together with Silvia to the rehearsal?’
<00000327> So I asked them to wait for me as I hurried back to my hotel room.
<00000328> 
<00000329> black450
<00000330> As I entered the bathroom, my plan was to just take a brief shower, but then I changed my mind and thought I might as well take a bath.

<00000353> I quickly got up and took my shower, and waited anxiously for the ‘top’ she had mentioned―

<00000365> 
<00000366> This wasn't anything extravagant, but spending my time carefreely like this was my greatest pleasure.

<00000395> It's not that I'm being overconfident, but I understand quite clearly how he feels about me.

<00000780> v06si0466
<00000781> シルヴ「Angelina!」
<00000782>  She called my name.

<00000784> アンジ「How boisterous you are, Dua. It is as if you were Silvia.」
<00000785> st06_b04
<00000786> v06si0467
<00000787> シルヴ「...S-sorry, you're Christina right now, right?」
<00000788> Faced with my sigh, the very least she could do is realize. But even though she had apologized, there was still one problem.
<00000789> 
<00000790> v00an1431
<00000791> アンジ「Next time, shall you continue to refer to me as ‘Christina’ as well?」
<00000792> st06_b05
<00000793> v06si0468
<00000794> シルヴ「Oh right, it was ‘Princess’ in the script. Princess, princess, princess... alright, I remember now!」
<00000795> ...Seems like she really would call me that if I hadn't reminded her.
<00000796> v00an1432
<00000797> アンジ「Alright, let's do it once more...」
<00000798> After Silvia had gone back to the other end of the stage, I gave her the signal once more.
<00000799>  ...Then, she came walking towards me with more refined steps.
<00000800> st06_b04
<00000801> v06si0469
<00000802> シルヴ「Princess!
<00000803> ...Pfft!」
<00000804> So this time she's going to ad-lib some laughter.
<00000805> v00an1433
<00000806> アンジ「Have you something funny to share with me, Dua?」
<00000807> v06si0470
<00000808> シルヴ「S-sorry!
<00000809> I'm really sorry! 
<00000810> I'm not laughing at you, honest!」
<00000811> v00an1434

<00000817> シルヴ「It's difficult doing something you're not used to, huh.」
<00000818> v00an1435
<00000819> アンジ「...Well, then relax a little, and try to perform naturally?」
<00000820> I believed that it wasn't that she wasn't taking this seriously enough and failing to act Dua's part, but because she was too concerned with trying to perform well, thus causing her to fail.
<00000821> 
<00000822> v00an1436
<00000823> アンジ「I'm not going to force you.」
<00000824> Misspeaking a few lines in the real performance isn't a big deal.
<00000825> However, Silvia is in quite a few influential scenes. If she makes too many mistakes, it might even disrupt the entire play.
<00000826> 
<00000827> v00an1437
<00000828> アンジ「If you think that the script is too difficult, you'd better tell Wakaba right now, and let her revise it a little...」
<00000829> st06_b00
<00000830> v06si0473
<00000831> シルヴ「It's okay, I'll somehow show you how it's done before the real show.」
<00000832> st06_d06
<00000833> v06si0474
<00000834> シルヴ「...Believe in me, Your Highness.」
<00000835> She gave me a thumbs-up as she said that.
<00000836>  It was so like her style to do that... still, she's only getting further away from Dua's image.

<00000854> she answered.
<00000855> Now that she mentions it, she had brought Coco to her house the first few times, but at some point, she had started going to Cero's house to talk to her instead.
<00000856> 
<00000857> 
<00000858> And when Wakaba finally came back at night, she would shut herself inside her room with nothing to be heard of her but the clacking of her typewriter. It had been like that all this while.

<00000291> After noticing that Belle's delivery had gotten smoother, I suggested she add gestures to her speech.
<00000292> st01_a00

<00000455> v00an0498
<00000456> アンジ「This is Aubergine. We all got off the train as we'd originally planned.」
<00000457> v01be0427

<00000459> st00_a06
<00000460> v00an0499
<00000461> アンジ「...I guess you wouldn't. That's because you were unconscious at the time.」
<00000462> v01be0428
<00000463> ベル「Eh?」
<00000464> According to Angelina's explanation―
<00000465> It seems like when she'd returned to the room that night, I was already asleep, so she hadn't disturbed me.
<00000466> I was still asleep until the next morning, and only opened my eyes when we were almost at Aubergine.
<00000467> But it was only natural that I didn't have any memories of that time, since I'd been in a daze and hadn't answered even when someone said my name.
<00000468> st00_a00
<00000469> v00an0500
<00000470> アンジ「...In the end, all of us got off the train in Aubergine.」
<00000471> I never thought it would turn out like this.
<00000472> I felt as if a piece of my life had been cut away, which was a little scary.
<00000473> v00an0501
<00000474> アンジ「After that, we went into the hotel for the meeting that Cero set up, since he'd talked to you beforehand and... that's it.」
<00000475> 
<00000476> Angelina's explanation had cleared things up for me. Now I knew the source of the problem.
<00000477>  It was entirely my fault that this had all happened.
<00000478> v01be0429
<00000479> ベル「...I'm sorry. It seems like I've caused trouble for you all.」
<00000480> st00_a03
<00000481> v00an0502
<00000482> アンジ「What are you talking about? We were planning to stop here anyway. Also, I'm the one... who should be apologizing.」

<00000488> st00_a08
<00000489> v00an0503
<00000490> アンジ「And that was because I forced you to practice.」
<00000491> v01be0431
<00000492> ベル「That's not it. I just... ate too much.」

<00000498> ベル「The tranquilizing Drops.」
<00000499> 
<00000500> 
<00000501> After practicing with Angelina, I still couldn't calm down, so I used the items that Father had given me.
<00000502> 
<00000503> Those were the leftovers from the Drops that I used on my way to the Blue Capital.
<00000504> 
<00000505> 
<00000506> v01be0433
<00000507> ベル「That kind of Drop prioritizes physical health, making sure homeostasis is maintained and everything is normal. If I take it at the wrong time, then I won't wake up for a while...」

<00000514> v01be0434
<00000515> ベル「That's right. Once I messed up, and ended up sleeping for a whole day...」
<00000516> 
<00000517> At that moment, I realized my sense of time was askew.
<00000518> v01be0435

<00000520> st00_a00

<00000523> 
<00000524> Now I know roughly how long I've been unconscious, and the reason why.
<00000525> ...But, I couldn't calm down yet.
<00000526> v01be0436
<00000527> ベル「(―It never would've occurred to me that I would use the Drop incorrectly.)」
<00000528> 
<00000529> 
<00000530> 
<00000531> Not spitting out the old ones before swallowing the new ones... It's the first time I've made that mistake.
<00000532>  
<00000533> 
<00000534> v01be0437
<00000535> ベル「I'm sorry. I don't know how I can apologize to everyone...」

<00000541> st00_a04
<00000542> v00an0508
<00000543> アンジ「When we first got here, everyone was squeezing into this room. Since they were getting in the way, I drove them out. Having one person here is more than enough, anyway.」
<00000544> 
<00000545> As I saw her rolled up her sleeves jokingly, I couldn't help but laugh. But if that happened this afternoon...
<00000546> 
<00000547> v01be0439
<00000548> ベル「...What time is it now?」
<00000549> st00_a05

<00000554> st00_a00
<00000555> v00an0510
<00000556> アンジ「I didn't have anything else to do, and I was reading a book anyway. Don't worry about it. Also, don't apologize, okay?」
<00000557> Since she had already predicted what I was going to say, I silently bowed my head.
<00000558> Angelina said, ‘Let's wait and see how you do for a while longer, and if you've really recovered, I'll go tell everyone,’ then sat on the chair beside my bed.

<00000562> When I woke up and looked at the clock once more, only thirty minutes had passed.
<00000563> v01be0441
<00000564> ベル「(―I guess the side effects of the Drop have already vanished.)」
<00000565> 
<00000566> 
<00000567> Normally, as long as there was no problem with my body, I could just spit out the excess Drops with my own strength.
<00000568> 
<00000569> But this time... it would be wise for me to wait for Father to arrive.

<00000574> 
<00000575> I noticed she was tidying up a bunch of papers.
<00000576> v01be0442
<00000577> ベル「It's okay. By the way, what were you reading?」
<00000578> I was more curious about the contents of it.

<00000581> アンジ「This? This is the outline of Wakaba's play. I borrowed it from her when we arrived at the hotel.」
<00000582> 
<00000583> 
<00000584> 
<00000585> 
<00000586> As she flipped through the sheets of paper, she nodded to herself.

<00000597> 
<00000598> She cheerfully passed me Wakaba's papers.
<00000599>  Something like ‘Lovey Dovey Princess and the Doll’ was written on them, which made me feel a little embarrassed.

<00000611> 
<00000612> 
<00000613> 
<00000614> Schwester.
<00000615> It seems like I'll have to get used to being called that myself.

<00000651> At first, I had thought that was just some fantasy Wakaba created by herself.

<00000730> 
<00000731> And the closest building that looked like a restaurant had been... here.
<00000732> Judging by all the wine bottles tightly packed on the wall behind the counter, this is probably what they call a ‘tavern.’
<00000733>

<00000744> A few customers glanced at us, some even widened their eyes.
<00000745> ...But the barkeeper, an old man, did not drive us out. Instead he quietly pointed us over to the seats in front of the counter.

<00000752> I looked at the menu, and chose an affordable dish.

<00000988> トニ―「Well, now all that's left is the barkeep's compensation, and then you can leave.」

<00000068> I kept that thought to myself, without letting it show on my face, and brought Belle's shoes over to the bedside.

<00000151> If he'd gotten excited and went too far, I could have just put a stop to it then.

<00000431> On the piece of paper she handed to me, there was a list: Memory Stone, Movement Stone, Five Senses Stone, and some others.
<00000432> A column of numbers were aligned beside the words; seems like this is what she meant by ‘not cheap.’

<00000435> To be sure, I counted with my fingers under the table― and realized that the total amount was somewhere in between all of my money and half of it.

<00000440> シルヴ「Well, I'll give you a discount if the full price is beyond your means. Besides, it's hard to find a customer for these.」
<00000441> Silvia closed her eyes and murmured ‘Just like it's hard to find us engineers,’ before rising from her chair.

<00000459> After pinching Tonino's smiling cheek, she left.

<00000467> v04ce0913
<00000468> セロ「What is it?」
<00000469> After confirming that Silvia was definitely gone, Tonino called to me and, waving his hand, invited me over to the table in the middle.

<00000477> v04ce0914
<00000478> セロ「Eh? Why?」
<00000479> 
<00000480> Wasn't she just worrying about whether I could afford it or not?
<00000481> st07_a04
<00000482> v07to0052
<00000483> トニ―「Well, how should I say it, she's too softhearted. But, if that happens, then I won't get my mediator's fee either...」
<00000484> According to Tonino's rough explanation, she's honest about the price before taking on the job, but when it came time to pay up, she'll be magnanimous and say ‘It's okay.’
<00000485> It'll be troublesome for us, the ones she's working for, if she doesn't accept the money.
<00000486> v04ce0915
<00000487> セロ「I'll definitely pay. Even if she doesn't want it, I'll forcibly give it to her. If not, then...」
<00000488> I took out my wallet and checked the amount of cash in it, then deducted the minimum amount needed for the hotel fee and other expenses.
<00000489> ...If I were better at math, I could have handed it over to him straight away.
<00000490> I wasn't, so I had to calm down and calculate carefully. As a result, I found out that it'd be fine even if I gave them half of the money I had with me.
<00000491> 
<00000492> v04ce0916

<00000498> v04ce0917
<00000499> セロ「It's fine, since this is just part of the money I'll have to pay anyway...」
<00000500> If it's still not enough, I'll have to borrow some money to pay them before Rein arrives.

<00000513> I thought she'd overheard our conversation, but luckily it seems she hadn't noticed anything.

<00000519> 
<00000520>  
<00000521> 
<00000522> I told Silvia that I was heading back to the room to get Belle's approval first, then left the pub in a hurry.

<00000561> シルヴ「Hmph! You, of course.」
<00000562> 
<00000563> During Cero's introduction, I had accidentally let ‘I've heard so much about you...’ slip out.
<00000564> st07_a01
<00000565> v07to0060
<00000566> トニ―「That's why you should pay more attention to ever-dependable me,」
<00000567> he said, showing off how he'd covered for me.
<00000568> v06si0029
<00000569> シルヴ「...Fine, fine.」
<00000570> As a partner, Tonino was definitely not bad.
<00000571> He usually acts as my driver, but he'd brought me a customer this time.
<00000572> He was too much of a lightweight to be my drinking partner, but he'd overlook it when I got too smashed.

<00000606> シルヴ「Don't make me remember that dis-gus-ting person!」
<00000607> Back then, I'd heard that there was someone who was willing to purchase Drops in bulk, so I'd dropped by his house.
<00000608> 
<00000609> 
<00000610> But waiting for me was a lewd old man.
<00000611> If he'd just touched my hands or shoulders, I could endure it, but―

<00000624> If it's Tonino, I can just slap him and forget about it, but I couldn't forgive that old man so easily.
<00000625> After slapping him on the cheek, I'd pushed him over and kicked his ass, but, to make it worse, he'd made weird noises like ‘Ahn~!’ for me to hear!
<00000626> 
<00000627> Disgusted, I'd left him like that and went back, but the next morning...
<00000628> We'd been labeled a ‘Drop stealing team,’ and thus unwillingly made our criminal debut.

<00000644> I'll have to get a lot of cash out of our current customer― Cero.
<00000645> Of course, I'll properly fix any problem that falls between the beginner and middle levels in doll engineering.
<00000646> ...With the cheapest Drops that will do the job, that is.
<00000647>

<00000668> 
<00000669> There's nothing I can do if the Sister isn't here.
<00000670> Well, I could have just handed Cero a couple of Drops and told him ‘This should be enough, I'll leave the rest to you!’, but my conscience wouldn't allow it.
<00000671>

<00000097> In search of Coco, I headed down the road in the direction Wakaba had pointed.

<00000237> Though we'd had a hard time in the Blue Capital, we had still been able to manage. This time, though, it seemed that we have no choice but to depend on the strength of Rein's name.

<00000010> v01be0463
<00000011> ベル「...Yes. I'm much better now.」
<00000012> After Cero had phoned me the day before yesterday to tell me of my daughter Belle's situation, I had been nervous for awhile.
<00000013> 
<00000014> 
<00000015> 
<00000016> ...Luckily, her condition hadn't worsened since then.
<00000017> She'd recovered enough to go out for a walk the day before, so it seems like it wasn't necessary for me to worry.
<00000018> v11re0198
<00000019> レイン「How unlike you to fall sick... even though it was my fault.」
<00000020> I had given her those Drops when she'd left for the Blue Capital for medical reasons- namely, to help her if being in an unfamilar place was making her anxious.
<00000021> 
<00000022> 
<00000023> Originally, I had intended to give her just one, but it seems like I'd been acting senile... and gave her too many, causing her to fall ill.
<00000024> st01_a03
<00000025> v01be0464
<00000026> ベル「No, it's not your fault. I'm the one who made a mistake.」
<00000027> My daughter shook her head as she tried to comfort me.
<00000028> Since we've been father and daughter for over half a century, we each knew each other's personality well.
<00000029> Recently, she's grown to accomodate me.
<00000030> black450

<00000034> v11re0200
<00000035> レイン「...Mmm.」
<00000036> I decided to perform Belle's maintenance as I investigated the problem.
<00000037> To humans, this would be like as conducting an interview while doing an operation.
<00000038> It was a method of treatment found only in doll engineering.
<00000039> ev014c
<00000040> v11re0201
<00000041> レイン「You haven't spit your Drops out yet, right?」

<00000043> 
<00000044> v01be0465
<00000045> ベル「No, I haven't.」
<00000046> Some engineers don't like performing these tasks simultaneously, as they worry it will decrease their accuracy, but this way was easier for me.
<00000047> v11re0202
<00000048> レイン「Then, I'll take them out.」
<00000049> As I had thought, the main reason she wasn't feeling well was because the energy the Drops emitted surpassed the limits of what her body could handle.
<00000050> 
<00000051> 
<00000052> ...But, somehow I felt that that wasn't the only problem.
<00000053> ev014d
<00000054> v11re0203
<00000055> レイン「...Are you concerned about something?」

<00000058> v11re0204
<00000059> レイン「That's right. There seems to be an uncertain tremor in a few of your stones.」
<00000060> My daughter's ambivalence was revealed by the behavior of her stones.
<00000061> v11re0205
<00000062> レイン「Do you have something on your mind?」
<00000063> ev014e
<00000064> v01be0467
<00000065> ベル「...Yes.」
<00000066> She had paused before answering me.
<00000067> That meant that her answer came from a place close to her subconscious.
<00000068> 
<00000069> 
<00000070> v11re0206
<00000071> レイン「It's about the theater festival, right? Do you still have any misgivings about participating with them?」

<00000073> ベル「...I don't know.」
<00000074> v11re0207
<00000075> レイン「Hmm. Rather than misgivings, it's unease, right?」

<00000078> ev014c
<00000079> v11re0208
<00000080> レイン「As for why you're uneasy... I don't think it's necessary to ask that question.」
<00000081> The main reason Wakaba had invited my daughter was because she was a Sister.
<00000082> 
<00000083> 
<00000084> But, she had asked more of Belle than that.
<00000085> v11re0209
<00000086> レイン「(―Singing, eh...)」
<00000087> I stopped questioning her, and began thinking... wondering what the best solution would be.
<00000088> 
<00000089> I could temporarily reinforce her willpower via tuning.
<00000090> Or I could do nothing but believe in her, and trust that she can overcome this by herself and sing.
<00000091> What should I do, as a father?
<00000092> ev014d
<00000093> v11re0210
<00000094> レイン「...What a quandary.」
<00000095> Even at this age, I still can't act without hesitation.
<00000096> But the compass needle within my heart always points in one direction.
<00000097> v11re0211
<00000098> レイン「(―Failure is a stepping stone to success...)」
<00000099> No matter what happens, gaining experience is the most important thing of all.
<00000100> And all living creatures mature through the path they have chosen by themselves.
<00000101> That's why I shouldn't interfere, and leave the choice for her to make.
<00000102> ev014a
<00000103> v11re0212
<00000104> レイン「...Do you want to sing in front of others?」

<00000106> ベル「...Yes.」
<00000107> v11re0213
<00000108> レイン「If that's the case, I'll give you another Drop later.」
<00000109> 
<00000110> 
<00000111> I tried to reuse the Drop that couldn't be used to maintain her body.
<00000112> This time, I imbued it with a different effect: to help her stand before others without becoming nervous, and to allow her to concentrate and focus her strength.
<00000113> v11re0214
<00000114> レイン「...I'll leave it for you to decide if you want to use it or not.」
<00000115> 
<00000116> Her life is hers alone.
<00000117> 
<00000118> 
<00000119> 
<00000120>

<00000241> 
<00000242> The manager stood in front of the line, and gave a speech to the crowd explaining the choir's goals.

<00000282> Just like I don't know much about Drops, either.

<00000084> She entered her role and switched her tone of voice to that of a princess.
<00000085> I too must be more like the stern retainer that I am. With that thought, I took a deep breath and nodded to signal that we should start.

<00000108> Faced with the astounded princess, Ein raised his head.
<00000109> v07to0429
<00000110> トニー「The Red and Blue Kingdom have already been talking in secret.」
<00000111> v07to0430

<00000193> Even though I said that flippantly, actually, my heart was pounding with nervousness from the fear of messing up.
<00000194> Still, our practice had gone well, not just because I was good at memorizing my lines...
<00000195> 
<00000196> But because my partner was Angelina, an outstanding actor.

<00000214> Just like that, the conversation shifted to what Silvia thinks about me.
<00000215> Was I like a lover to her... or was I just convenient to have around?

<00000232> I'm talking about when you practice together as the Princess and the Schwester.」
<00000233> I couldn't help but smirk at Angelina's nervous face.
<00000234> So even she, who always remains composed even if you teased her, is unable to hide how she feels when someone mentions the name ‘Belle.’

<00000241> That's right, you shouldn't tease grown-ups.

<00000409> I wasn't used to people praising me.
<00000410> When I was a child, I always thought of it as fake flattery, so that became a habit and I couldn't accept honest praise.

<00000422> v06si0693

<00000461> If she'd try to juggle being both an actress and a doll engineer just because of a momentary impulse, I have to be strict with her even if it wasn't entirely honest.

<00000544> 
<00000545> He didn't admit it clearly, nor did he deny it.

<00000661> A long time ago.
<00000662> 
<00000663> Within the mines of the Red Kingdom, a great quantity of gemstone had been extracted, and a certain someone discovered it to have a special power.
<00000664> 
<00000665> It was in fact quite the accident.
<00000666> When he was toying with a pendant made of the gemstone, he had accidentally dropped it.
<00000667> \p\wIt had landed upon a doll, and the doll had begun to move a tiny bit. That was how it happened.
<00000668> At first, the animate dolls that were being created were simple things made of wood and cloth and served as children's toys.
<00000669> 
<00000670> But, drawn by the stone's mysterious properties, adults became interested as well as children.
<00000671> 
<00000672> After many long years, more of these gemstones were discovered with different powers... and the Red Kingdom devoted itself to researching them.
<00000673> 
<00000674> Eventually, they were able to create dolls that resembled humans.

<00000683> Their popularity was spurred on by human curiosity, and soon enough, news of the dolls spread to countries near and far.
<00000684> 
<00000685> Naturally, the Red Kingdom demonstrated its new art to the Blue Kingdom and many nobles grew interested.
<00000686>  
<00000687> 
<00000688> 
<00000689> Soon the agriculture to which the Red Kingdom had devoted its vast lands was replaced by a mining economy.
<00000690> 
<00000691> 
<00000692> 
<00000693> In turn, the Blue Kingdom with its overseas trade connections prospered by exporting the goods produced.
<00000694> 
<00000695>  
<00000696> 
<00000697> That was how the two kingdoms' business relationship was established. Through the trading of ‘dolls,’ it developed at an impressive pace.

<00000709> The kingdom of Weiss is located upon the border of the two kingdoms, and was established to serve as a symbol of peace between the two kingdoms.

<00000720> But amidst these breakthroughs, there were a few that were named the ‘Secret Recipes.’
<00000721> These Secret Recipes are shared only among the descendents of the house of Dorn. You can say that they were the single defining characteristic of our royalty.

<00000031> Several seconds after there was a knock upon the door,
<00000032> v25du0074
<00000033> デュア「―Lord Ein. Are you in there?」
<00000034> Dua's well-mannered voice entered my ears.
<00000035> v24ei0110
<00000036> アイン「Come in, it's not locked.」
<00000037> There are only a few people who would come to visit me in my office at such an early hour.
<00000038> v24ei0111
<00000039> アイン「(―The Lady, Dua...)」
<00000040> v24ei0112
<00000041> アイン「...Or Coco.」
<00000042> Just remembering that little guest of ours brought a faint smile to my face.
<00000043> v25du0075
<00000044> デュア「―Sorry to disturb you.」
<00000045> dua_b01
<00000046> Conscientious as always, she made sure to shut the door behind her before approaching my desk, and then bowed courteously.
<00000047> 
<00000048> I've told Dua countless times that she doesn't need to be so formal, but she's stubborn.
<00000049> 
<00000050> v24ei0113
<00000051> アイン「You're here early as usual. So, what's the hurry?」
<00000052> v25du0076
<00000053> デュア「No, it's not a particularly urgent matter― but I would like to remind you that the meeting to prepare the budget is today.」
<00000054> 
<00000055> 
<00000056> 
<00000057> v24ei0114
<00000058> アイン「Ah. I see.」
<00000059> In order to govern this kingdom, there's a great deal of paperwork that needs to be done.
<00000060> I must take particular care to properly document its finances.
<00000061> v24ei0115
<00000062> アイン「(―Looks like more paperwork is coming.)」
<00000063> Generations ago, each minister would read their budgetary requests during this meeting and, if there were no objections, they'd be approved.
<00000064> 
<00000065> However, as I see it, the resurrection of this ancient practice only weakens the symbolism of making these entreaties directly to the sovereign instead.
<00000066> 
<00000067> v24ei0116
<00000068> アイン「...This is all such nonsense.」
<00000069> dua_b04
<00000070> v25du0077
<00000071> デュア「Huh?」
<00000072> v24ei0117
<00000073> アイン「The existence of the preparatory meeting, I mean.」
<00000074> dua_b05
<00000075> v25du0078
<00000076> デュア「...I'll keep that in mind...」
<00000077> Finding it difficult to voice her opinion before me, she averted her eyes and muttered something.
<00000078> 
<00000079> dua_b01
<00000080> It seemed she had something on her mind, but I did not feel the need to go out of my way to inquire about it.
<00000081> 
<00000082> v24ei0118
<00000083> アイン「(―Regarding the documents they shall submit...)」
<00000084> \p\wInvariably, those pages are packed with useless platitudes that exist only to make a fine speech, burying the truth in dubious agendas.
<00000085> With not a shred of credibility to them, they were worse than blank sheets of paper.
<00000086> 
<00000087> 
<00000088> Such are the grand accomplishment of the meetings we have when it comes time to draft a budget, when the ministers make their reports and examine those of their peers.
<00000089> 
<00000090> At that time, the ministers are asked to defend any questionable or unclear aspects of their report. If they cannot do so, their budget requests will be refused.
<00000091> 
<00000092> v24ei0119
<00000093> アイン「Strictly speaking, the preparatory meetings are a complete waste of time.」
<00000094> dua_b04
<00000095> v25du0079
<00000096> デュア「But Lord Ein, if you abolished the preparatory meeting, it's likely that someone like Lord Jussi would misunderstand and raise an outcry...」
<00000097> 
<00000098> v24ei0120
<00000099> アイン「...I know.」
<00000100> I must prevent people of that sort from increasing in number.
<00000101> 
<00000102> dua_b05
<00000103> v25du0080
<00000104> デュア「I apologize for being so impertinent with my opinion.」
<00000105> v24ei0121
<00000106> アイン「No, you are quite right. Let's leave things as they are.」
<00000107> \p\wIf possible, I'd prefer to deal with the record holder for wasting the most time during preparatory meetings as little as possible.
<00000108> 
<00000109> 
<00000110> v24ei0122
<00000111> アイン「―By the way, what business have you with me today?」
<00000112> dua_b01
<00000113> v25du0081
<00000114> デュア「...Yes. It is in regards to the proposal I made the day before yesterday to increase the number of imperial guards. May I inquire about your decision?」
<00000115> 
<00000116> 
<00000117> 
<00000118> v24ei0123
<00000119> アイン「...」
<00000120> I expected I would be pressed for an answer soon, but I didn't think it would be the first thing in the morning.
<00000121> v24ei0124
<00000122> アイン「Once again, you're quick to demand an answer today.」
<00000123> I shuffled through my desk and drawers in search of the relevant documents.
<00000124> 
<00000125> dua_b05
<00000126> v25du0082a
<00000127> デュア「...You don't have to give an answer right now, but I'm aware you often put off these sorts of tasks.」
<00000128> 
<00000129> dua_b01
<00000130> v25du0082b
<00000131> デュア「―I am simply reminding you to make your decision, that is all.」
<00000132> ...Hmm, where did I put it again...
<00000133> v24ei0125
<00000134> アイン「So you're saying you have always been able to read me like a book, eh?」
<00000135> dua_b04
<00000136> v25du0083
<00000137> デュア「As I am the captain of the guard, if I return without an answer every single time, my competence will be suspect.」
<00000138> 
<00000139> Dua replied with a sigh and a tired expression.
<00000140> I had been thinking that she'd become more gentle than she used to be, but some of her old bluntness still remains.
<00000141> dua_b01
<00000142> v25du0084
<00000143> デュア「By the way, I notice you seem to have been looking for something...」
<00000144> v24ei0126
<00000145> アイン「Is that so?」
<00000146> Her face didn't contain a single trace of sarcasm as she asked that. I wonder how she would react if she knew I was looking for the document she's been asking for―
<00000147> 
<00000148> With that as my motivation, I went through the entire stack, flipping through it page by page, but found nothing.
<00000149> 
<00000150> v24ei0127
<00000151> アイン「―Regarding those documents, may I deliver my answer to you later?」
<00000152> dua_b04
<00000153> v25du0085
<00000154> デュア「How long will it take?」
<00000155> v24ei0128
<00000156> アイン「I shall definitely have them for you some time today.」
<00000157> dua_b01
<00000158> v25du0086
<00000159> デュア「I understand.」
<00000160> Judging by her expression, she may have already figured out my problem.
<00000161> 
<00000162> So I closed the drawer, took a deep breath, and stared at the captain of the guard standing before me.
<00000163> 
<00000164> dua_b06
<00000165> v25du0087
<00000166> デュア「...Is there something on my face?」
<00000167> v24ei0129
<00000168> アイン「Nope. Nothing at all.」
<00000169> dua_b01
<00000170> v25du0088
<00000171> デュア「...?」
<00000172> Nothing was the matter, but I did not care to have her question me further, so I tried to steer the conversation to less serious affairs.
<00000173> 
<00000174> v24ei0130
<00000175> アイン「By the way, about those two girls, Efa and Coco. What are they doing?」
<00000176> v25du0089
<00000177> デュア「I've told them to stay put until the preparatory meeting has finished.」
<00000178> v24ei0131

<00000180> dua_b04
<00000181> v25du0090
<00000182> デュア「What do you mean?」
<00000183> v24ei0132
<00000184> アイン「I was wondering why Coco wasn't here yet, even though it's around the time she usually comes to play.」
<00000185> 
<00000186> v25du0091
<00000187> デュア「Coco? She comes here?」
<00000188> 
<00000189> v24ei0133
<00000190> アイン「That's right. Yesterday we played hide and seek, and Coco hid behind that door over there.」
<00000191> She had thought she was well hidden, but her wind-up key was showing.
<00000192> 
<00000193> v25du0092
<00000194> デュア「If she is interrupting your work, I can entertain Coco in your stead...」
<00000195> v24ei0134
<00000196> アイン「No, that won't be necessary. In fact, it makes a perfect break.」

<00000200> デュア「...If that is what you wish, Lord Ein.」
<00000201> v24ei0135
<00000202> アイン「Hm? Is there some problem with it?」
<00000203> dua_b06
<00000204> v25du0094
<00000205> デュア「―No. I am just not used to them yet.」
<00000206> v24ei0136
<00000207> アイン「You are speaking of Efa and Coco?」
<00000208> dua_b05
<00000209> v25du0095
<00000210> デュア「―Yes.」
<00000211> Coco from the Blue Kingdom and Efa from the Red Kingdom.
<00000212> They were summoned here to perform in the play ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings,’ as part of our memorial ceremony.
<00000213> 
<00000214> But as we are a small kingdom, it is not an overreaction to be cautious of those two dolls.
<00000215>

<00000217> 
<00000218> dua_b01
<00000219> v25du0096

<00000223> アイン「You mean ‘if,’ right?」
<00000224> v25du0097
<00000225> デュア「Yes... am I thinking too much?」
<00000226> v24ei0138
<00000227> アイン「No, not at all. You're speaking as a person whose duty it is to protect the Princess, so you're right.」
<00000228> dua_b05
<00000229> v25du0098
<00000230> デュア「...」
<00000231> v24ei0139

<00000233> 
<00000234> v25du0099
<00000235> デュア「No, it is not that. It is just that I am having difficulty sorting out my emotions.」
<00000236> 
<00000237> v24ei0140
<00000238> アイン「You're trying to say that your personal feelings are at odds with your professional duties, correct?」
<00000239> dua_b01
<00000240> v25du0100
<00000241> デュア「―Yes. Especially regarding Coco...」
<00000242> v24ei0141
<00000243> アイン「―Say no more. I understand.」
<00000244> I could not express it in words, but Coco has a mysterious charm that draws people to her.
<00000245> v24ei0142
<00000246> アイン「(―It would be fitting to say that she is an ‘existence blessed by God's love.’)」
<00000247> When one speaks to Coco, it's impossible to be suspicious of her.
<00000248> 
<00000249> v24ei0143
<00000250> アイン「...Still, don't let your guard down.」

<00000253> dua_b05
<00000254> v25du0101
<00000255> デュア「...Yes.」
<00000256> Still, there is a problem regarding the relationship between the Lady and the dolls that Dua doesn't know about yet.
<00000257> 
<00000258> v24ei0145
<00000259> アイン「I wish to confirm something. Have there been any problems with Coco and Efa recently?」

<00000278> デュア「...Actually, there is one small problem...」
<00000279> Her words more circumspect than usual, Dua glanced towards the door.

<00000290> I composed myself and waited for her report.
<00000291> dua_b01
<00000292> Dua cleared her throat, then took one step forward.
<00000293> v25du0107
<00000294> デュア「It was a few days ago. Coco and the Princess were practicing for the play, when I spotted some suspicious people watching them from the guest room.」

<00000312> Last night I had passed by a statesman's horse-drawn wagon near the castle gates.
<00000313>

<00000315> I had been headed for the castle, while that wagon was leaving.

<00000326> From the sound of it, something must have happened to make her so angry.

<00000329> dua_b05

<00000360> アイン「I mean exactly what I just said.」
<00000361> dua_b05
<00000362> A few days ago, while I was chatting with Coco, Dua had suddenly appeared without me having noticed her approach.
<00000363> 
<00000364> She is the Princess's bodyguard, so I suppose she's used to keeping a low profile.
<00000365> 
<00000366> v24ei0160
<00000367> アイン「Never mind. Please continue.」
<00000368> dua_b04
<00000369> v25du0120
<00000370> デュア「―At first, I was surprised that Valery knew my name.」
<00000371> 
<00000372> v24ei0161
<00000373> アイン「...So, he addressed you by name.」
<00000374> v25du0121
<00000375> デュア「Yes. He was a man I'd never met before, and yet he called me by my name before anything else.」
<00000376> 
<00000377> v24ei0162
<00000378> アイン「―And then he said ‘As an ambassador, of course I would remember the names of Princess Christina's closest guards,’ right?」
<00000379> 
<00000380> dua_b06
<00000381> v25du0122
<00000382> デュア「...」
<00000383> \nDua looked at me with wide eyes, surprised.
<00000384> v24ei0163
<00000385> アイン「What is it?」
<00000386> v25du0123
<00000387> デュア「N-nothing, it's just... what you just said was exactly right, Lord Ein.」
<00000388> v24ei0164
<00000389> アイン「Oh, is that so.」
<00000390> It was just random conjecture, but it seemed to have been on the mark. I smiled thinly in response.
<00000391> 
<00000392> v24ei0165
<00000393> アイン「...Well? How did the people inside react to you?」
<00000394> dua_b04
<00000395> v25du0124
<00000396> デュア「―Lord Valery was calm and composed. The other two, however, seemed quite shaken.」
<00000397> 
<00000398> v25du0125
<00000399> デュア「Lord Jussi immediately assured me that he was the one who invited these guests, and encouraged me to leave.」
<00000400> 
<00000401> v25du0126
<00000402> デュア「―Hans seemed nervous, exchanged a formal greeting with me and started making small talk in a shrill tone.」
<00000403> 
<00000404> v24ei0166
<00000405> アイン「They're quite a transparent lot.」
<00000406> Their reactions indicated that they were participating in some sort of confidential conversation.
<00000407> 
<00000408> dua_b05
<00000409> v25du0127
<00000410> デュア「My arrival had probably come as quite a surprise to them.」
<00000411> Judging from Lord Jussi's and Hans' reactions, as well as the presence of the new ambassador, one could not help but think they were plotting something in the shadows.
<00000412> 
<00000413> v24ei0167
<00000414> アイン「What happened afterwards?」
<00000415> dua_b04
<00000416> v25du0128
<00000417> デュア「I was about to excuse myself and depart, when Valery asked me if I would like some wine.」
<00000418> 
<00000419> v25du0129
<00000420> デュア「I politely declined, and so he requested that I keep their discussion a secret.」
<00000421> 
<00000422> v24ei0168
<00000423> アイン「Secret?」
<00000424> v25du0130
<00000425> デュア「...That's right. I refused the wine, and in return he asked me not to tell you about this.」
<00000426> 
<00000427> v24ei0169
<00000428> アイン「And yet, here you are...」
<00000429> dua_b05
<00000430> v25du0131
<00000431> デュア「Yes.」
<00000432> v24ei0170
<00000433> アイン「Is that all right? Breaking your promise with the Blue Kingdom's ambassador?」
<00000434> 
<00000435> dua_b04
<00000436> v25du0132
<00000437> デュア「I have not broken any promises. I told Lord Valery that it was useless to try and stop me from reporting. Despite that, he brushed aside my words and carried on talking.」
<00000438> 
<00000439> 
<00000440> Dua's personality is impressively straightforward.
<00000441> But she ought to be more careful of her words, in case they do more harm than good.
<00000442> Depending on the situation, there are times when you must leave your thoughts and feelings unsaid.
<00000443> v24ei0171
<00000444> アイン「―Well then, Lord Valery must have been taking into account that you would report anything you heard to me, so what did he say after that?」
<00000445> 
<00000446> If he had meant for their conversation to be overheard, then there's no harm in listening to it.
<00000447> 
<00000448> v25du0133
<00000449> デュア「From what I could gather, the three of them were talking about wine.」
<00000450> v24ei0172
<00000451> アイン「Wine?」
<00000452> v25du0134
<00000453> デュア「It was a wine that Lord Valery greatly admired, and he said he wanted to take it back to his own kingdom.」
<00000454> 
<00000455> v24ei0173
<00000456> アイン「That doesn't seem to be anything that needs to be kept secret...」
<00000457> dua_b05
<00000458> v25du0135
<00000459> デュア「...They were saying it was a brand of wine prohibited from leaving the country, and they argued over what to do with it.」
<00000460> 
<00000461> v24ei0174
<00000462> アイン「Oh?」
<00000463> v25du0136
<00000464> デュア「Lord Valery also said, ‘If this conversation reaches Lord Ein, whom I have not even met yet, his opinion of me shall suffer.’」
<00000465> 
<00000466> 
<00000467> 
<00000468> v25du0137
<00000469> デュア「Then, when I asked him why he had let me hear all that, as if he wanted me to...」
<00000470> 
<00000471> dua_b04
<00000472> v25du0138
<00000473> デュア「―He replied, ‘Well, that's because I thought you'd already heard plenty while you were standing outside’...!」
<00000474> v24ei0175
<00000475> アイン「He's a pretty cautious man. Lord Valery, that is.」
<00000476> It's hard to believe he was going so far just to bring home some wine he was fond of.
<00000477> 
<00000478> For normal citizens, that would be smuggling, but someone with the rank of an ambassador would be above such laws.
<00000479> 
<00000480> v25du0139
<00000481> デュア「...Also, he told me ‘If you could put in a word so that I could bring this wine past the border, I'd reward you generously.’ The cheek of it!」
<00000482> 
<00000483> v24ei0176

<00000485> dua_b03
<00000486> v25du0140
<00000487> デュア「Of course! Do I look like the sort of person who takes bribes!?」
<00000488> 
<00000489> 
<00000490> v24ei0177
<00000491> アイン「No.」
<00000492> dua_b04
<00000493> v25du0141
<00000494> デュア「Please, Lord Ein, do not trifle with me like that...! Anyway, as soon as I refused, he leered at me and―」
<00000495> 
<00000496> v24ei0178
<00000497> アイン「What did he say?」
<00000498> dua_b03
<00000499> v25du0142
<00000500> デュア「―That man casually told me ‘I could introduce you to some fine young noble blood. Which do you prefer? Men? Or perhaps women?’!」
<00000501> 
<00000502> v25du0143
<00000503> デュア「On top of that, he even said I'd be given plenty of time so I could inspect them to my heart's content!」
<00000504> 
<00000505> bg58a01
<00000506> Shoulders trembling, she clenched her fist and was about to slam it down on my desk...
<00000507> 
<00000508> but regained control of herself at the last second.
<00000509> dua_b05
<00000510> v25du0144
<00000511> デュア「...I-I humbly apologize.」
<00000512> \nShe calmed herself and took a step back.
<00000513> v24ei0179
<00000514> アイン「The fault is mine. I seem to have dredged up an unpleasant memory for you.」
<00000515> 
<00000516> v25du0145
<00000517> デュア「...No, I should have put my feelings aside and given a more objective report of the situation. For that, I apologize.」
<00000518> 
<00000519> I understood it was hard for Dua, but I could not console her.
<00000520> Adopting a professional attitude with her and assuring her I would carry out my duties faithfully was the most I could do.
<00000521> v24ei0180
<00000522> アイン「―Dua. This situation... do you think there's more to it than meets the eye?」
<00000523> dua_b04
<00000524> v25du0146
<00000525> デュア「Yes, I do. What about you, Lord Ein?」
<00000526> v24ei0181
<00000527> アイン「At least concerning this ‘wine’ that they're trying to sneak out of the kingdom.」
<00000528> Had it actually been the illegal export of some wine they were discussing, it would not be difficult for someone like Valery, since he is an ambassador.
<00000529> 
<00000530> 
<00000531> 
<00000532> Which means there's something more to it, and they've established this facade to cover up their real intentions.
<00000533> 
<00000534> v24ei0182
<00000535> アイン「Did Lord Jussi or Hans say anything?」
<00000536> v25du0147
<00000537> デュア「They said little while I was there. They left all the talking to Valery, all they did was nod and agree with him.」
<00000538> 
<00000539> v24ei0183
<00000540> アイン「Before Lord Valery began speaking to you, did he communicate with the two in some way?」
<00000541> v25du0148
<00000542> デュア「...Yes. He turned his eyes to them, and they both nodded.」
<00000543> v24ei0184
<00000544> アイン「―I see.」
<00000545> In other words, he signaled for them not to say anything unnecessary.
<00000546> Though I have not even met Lord Valery yet, I could already tell that he was undoubtedly a man I must not take lightly.
<00000547> 
<00000548> v24ei0185
<00000549> アイン「(―Or rather...)」
<00000550> \nI have a gut feeling that he's definitely an enemy of this kingdom.
<00000551> v24ei0186
<00000552> アイン「So then, what shall we do about this?」
<00000553> v25du0149
<00000554> デュア「―If you wish, I can offer them my cooperation and investigate further...」
<00000555> v24ei0187
<00000556> アイン「No. They're already wary of you, no doubt. You're not suited to the role of a spy.」
<00000557> v25du0150
<00000558> デュア「Then, is there someone else who...」
<00000559> v24ei0188
<00000560> アイン「―Indeed. Let us find someone from outside the castle.」
<00000561> dua_b06

<00000563> デュア「Outside of the castle?」
<00000564> v24ei0189
<00000565> アイン「As the two of us live within the castle, there are things we cannot see.」
<00000566> 
<00000567> 
<00000568> 
<00000569> I can only think of three people who would be suited for this task.
<00000570> One of them has been a servant in the Osborne household for many years.
<00000571> It's best to strike at the opponent with the weakest defenses, therefore we will begin by investigating Lord Jussi.
<00000572> 
<00000573> 
<00000574> v24ei0190
<00000575> アイン「I will dispatch a messenger and make the preparations immediately. The rest I shall leave in your hands, are we clear?」
<00000576> 
<00000577> dua_b01
<00000578> v25du0152
<00000579> デュア「Understood.」
<00000580> To this day, I have overcome the attacks of many political opponents.
<00000581> \p\wHowever, this time, we are faced with a foreign ambassador to whom our country has granted hospitality.
<00000582> Since he possesses a certain degree of immunity, we must exercise extreme caution in our investigation.
<00000583> 
<00000584> 
<00000585>  I don't enjoy being so forceful, but it was something that had to be said.
<00000586> v24ei0191
<00000587> アイン「One more thing. None of this shall be divulged to the Lady.」
<00000588> v25du0153

<00000609> The process of tuning, performed to balance a doll's mind, can sometimes produce unexpected results.
<00000610> 
<00000611> black450
<00000612> In the past, there was a doll I tuned who reacted in a similar manner - she too made these kinds of unusual predictions.

<00000614> v21cr0091
<00000615> クリス「(―Giselle...)」
<00000616> I was awash in nostalgia at the thought, though my memories of her were dim. Once I tried comparing the two, I realized she had little in common with Efa.

<00000625> My mood lifting as well, I placed my hands on Efa's shoulders and turned her around.
<00000626> I slowly embraced her, stroking her hair as our faces drew close to one another.

<00000638> If she is well, then I should call for Coco next, as she's waiting outside in the hallway.

<00000665> ...They then realized that she had much more potential than they had ever imagined.
<00000666> 
<00000667> She memorized entire scripts from just one reading. She was famous for being able to reproduce movements exactly as instructed.
<00000668> 
<00000669> Not only that, she even had the ability to perform impromptu without prior rehearsal.
<00000670> Ever since the day they had discovered her beautifully humming a complete etude, they had arranged her debut on stage.
<00000671> 
<00000672> \p\wA certain member of the Red Kingdom's royalty was impressed enough by her performance to put her on the list of national treasures.

<00000725> Theatre is the most important thing to Efa.

<00000759> Since she has been staying with us for a while now, I feel she has the right to speak more freely.
<00000760> Those words of hers, ‘Please accept my utmost apologies’, were chosen due to the gravity of her role as a representative of the Red Kingdom. How pitiable.

<00000804> エファ「Yes.」
<00000805> When Efa agreed obediently, I felt relieved.

<00000824> クリス「(―Yes, this is how it should be.)」
<00000825> My desire was for a more casual and easy-going relationship.
<00000826> In a public setting, I can understand the need for formal speech. But when it's just the two of us, I'd like to be able to spend our time together more leisurely.

<00000870> That was a result of a mistake in my tuning. There's no way I could forget it.

<00000923> 
<00000924> Coco can always express her feelings without worry. She says what she wants to say and everything she does, she does with all her spirit.
<00000925> 
<00000926> Since Coco was raised and educated like an ordinary child, she knows how to express herself freely with her body language, even when words fail her.

<00000936> クリス「―I see. So that is how it was after all...」
<00000937> When I performed the tuning on Efa, I noticed the gems inside of her reacted sluggishly, and a portion of them were even misaligned.
<00000938> 
<00000939> These are symptoms of long periods of hibernation and then, conversely, equally long periods of activity and toil.
<00000940> 
<00000941> v21cr0140
<00000942> クリス「So you were only awoken when they wished you to perform?」
<00000943> v22ef0189
<00000944> エファ「Yes.」
<00000945> I can understand why they would want to preserve her durability, seeing as how she is the treasure of the kingdom.
<00000946> 
<00000947> However, that kind of attitude is not for the benefit of the doll. Rather, it is to serve human greed, which I cannot approve of.

<00000951> v22ef0190
<00000952> エファ「Yes... they will.」
<00000953> It was a fate that she did not even question.
<00000954> If I could do anything for her, I would like to change that fate of hers a little.

<00000961> クリス「(―Ah. That's not what I meant...)」
<00000962> What I meant to ask was whether she had any hope for the future, like hopeful dreams.
<00000963> Rising to the challenge, I inquired about a different topic.

<00000990> \nEfa remained silent for a while.

<00001005> v21cr0150
<00001006> クリス「...Is that so.」
<00001007> I, myself, understand the reason they behave that way far better than anyone else.
<00001008> Dua is devoted to her duties, and is always prepared to shield me from anyone who might wish me harm.
<00001009> 
<00001010> To that end, she constantly has her guard up and will not relax for a second, so that she is always prepared for the unexpected.
<00001011> 
<00001012> As for Ein, it's because he knows of my past, that is why―

<00001050> くりす「Well, Ein's just twice the worrywart compared to normal people.」
<00001051> Though that was no lie, I still apologized inside my heart for hiding things about one of my retainers to her.

<00001062> I considered this more deeply.

<00001105> v21cr0167
<00001106> クリス「(―And here I thought I would definitely be done in just five minutes...)」
<00001107> I'd gotten distracted by chatting with Efa, forgotten about Coco, and it looks like she must have lost her patience―

<00001119> If anyone were to go missing in this place, it would be natural that I take responsibility for the search.
<00001120> 
<00001121> But since Efa has offered her help, the affairs of the nation should be my top priority.

<00001134> 
<00001135> I cannot stand the fact that they place Efa inside a case and make her sleep.
<00001136> 
<00001137> A living doll should be allowed to walk among humans.
<00001138> But by making her experience time so, they've fated her never to know what it is to truly live―

<00001162> The manner in which he repeats the same things over and over again utterly exasperates me.
<00001163> 
<00001164> However, as the Princess' representative, I must wait patiently until the preparatory meeting has concluded.

<00001168> It's obvious his documentation is insufficient, and he has no excuse.

<00001176> It appears he is trying to remind the audience of Ein's father, Fritz Ronberg. This is a flat-out attack on Ein.

<00001178> Since Ein is not fazed at all by your posturing, please cut the gaudy speech.
<00001179> v25du0156
<00001180> デュア「(―Or is my thinking reflective of my own inexperience?)」
<00001181> As a matter of fact, he was actually dismissed from office.
<00001182> 
<00001183> \p\wBut he somehow convinced the cabinet master to give him a new position, thus he's an assistant minister at the moment.
<00001184> I was there when it happened. It was the first time I've ever seen a grown man cry like a child.

<00001193> ユッシ「That's right. Have I not been speaking of that all along?」
<00001194> If Jussi were a swordsman, he would be using the same kind of feint over and over, each time intending to strike at his opponent's heart.
<00001195> His moves are so obvious that if this were a battleground, he would have been killed with a single strike.

<00001225> That Lord Jussi was quite disturbed by the compromise that Lord Ein was offering was evident on his face.

<00001298> It is rare indeed that Lord Jussi demonstrates he is capable of rational thought.
<00001299> In response, Ein smiled reassuringly at him.

<00001490> 
<00001491> In an unexpected turn of events, Lord Jussi was desperately trying to downplay his words from earlier. What had caused him to act this way, I wonder?

<00001810> I bowed my head to them as they left, wondering why Lord Jussi had asked a question like that.
<00001811> 
<00001812> Could it be that during their meeting the other day, Lord Valery had asked them about my skills as a swordsman?
<00001813> 
<00001814> But even if that was true, it still doesn't really make sense that Lord Jussi would go out of his way to try and compare us...

<00001817> Was there some deeper meaning to that? Or was there not?
<00001818> Though I was concerned, right now it doesn't matter whether there was or not.
<00001819> I must return to my duties, and head for the Dolls' Room.
<00001820> I'm sure this feeling of discomfort will more or less vanish once I find Coco.
<00001821> 
<00001822> Bearing that in mind, I felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and even my footsteps felt lighter.

<00002734> Trying to bring Princess Christina out of this kingdom is kidnapping no matter how I look at it.

<00002747> ユッシ「...Which means, we'll need more allies after commencing the operation.」
<00002748> I'm sure that there are many beyond than the three of us who are dissatisfied with Ein.
<00002749> If we can successfully incite them, we can strip Ein of his position and establish a new government for the kingdom.

<00002753> 
<00002754> Unlike Ein, I am not the sort of person who's only good at paperwork and nothing else, so I had best prepare myself for the future.

<00002765> Straining my eyes, I saw that it was the doll from the Red Kingdom, Efa.
<00002766> She was blankly staring out the window, the two white wings on her back fluttering slightly.

<00002768> ユッシ「(―Which means Princess Christina is nearby, eh...)」
<00002769> I quickly hid the opened wine bottle behind my back.

<00002774> ユッシ「(―Hmm...)」
<00002775> It'll be hard getting past that doll to reach the guest room, though.
<00002776> 
<00002777> The only way I can avoid her is to take a roundabout route - taking the stairs down a floor, and then going back up another set of stairs further along.
<00002778> 
<00002779> But that's so troublesome.
<00002780> In addition, if I do that, and the doll has decided to leave by the time I arrived at the guest room... I would just feel stupid.

<00002782> v28ju0372
<00002783> ユッシ「(―Come on, just go away.)」

<00002790> ユッシ「(―That's why I hate dolls...)」
<00002791> They're so difficult to deal with.
<00002792> Maybe I should just make up my mind and go over to her, then somehow convince her to leave?
<00002793> 
<00002794> v28ju0375
<00002795> ユッシ「Nggh.」
<00002796> Still, the sight of those wings made me hesitate...

<00002798> ユッシ「(―Though I didn't really mind it that much when I met Coco yesterday...)」
<00002799> I just can't bring myself to get close to the Red Kingdom's doll, who, to my eyes, looks just like a human.
<00002800> Wracked with indecision, I gazed idly at the wine bottle in my hand as I tried to think of something.
<00002801> v28ju0377
<00002802> ユッシ「...Hm?」
<00002803> Just that moment, I recalled ‘something’ in my mind.

<00002812> v28ju0381
<00002813> ユッシ「Fufufu.」
<00002814> Princess Christina was not beside her.
<00002815> This is a perfect chance.
<00002816> I can talk to that doll and casually ask her about the ‘secret.’
<00002817> By doing that, and only that... that doll will surely tell me what she knew about it.
<00002818> v28ju0382
<00002819> ユッシ「―That's because she was created in such way that she cannot lie, after all.」
<00002820> I had learned about that from one of the Red Kingdom's citizens on the day she arrived... so there was no way she's going to lie.
<00002821> I can just ask her Coco's secret, straight out and open!

<00002857> Not only did she flatly deny it, the way she had said that made it sound as if she wished to end the conversation, so I was at a loss on what to say next.

<00000032> It was the shadow of her wings that I had seen when the lightning struck.
<00000033> I knew well what it was.
<00000034> Still, even if my mind understood it, my body was unable to follow suit.
<00000035> My legs trembled and my breath became ragged.
<00000036> I couldn't banish the thought that the black wings I had seen, at that moment, had betrayed the true nature of that doll- Efa.

<00000043> An image of a doll floated to my mind... a doll that did not look a bit like Efa.
<00000044> Face, eyes, mouth, nose- all crudely designed, as if they were crafted from scraps of wood simply thrown together.

<00000053> Its shape like that of a human skeleton, the doll had been taking a leisurely walk at the courtyard.
<00000054> 
<00000055> 
<00000056> And then, when the engineer ordered it to ‘catch that bird over there-’ all of a sudden, with speed comparable to that of a trained soldier, it went after the pigeon.

<00000064> 
<00000065> Obeying its orders, the wooden doll chased after the pigeon.
<00000066> Even when the pigeon took off flying into the sky, it continued its pursuit, leaping over the castle wall with its eyes fixated on its quarry―

<00000075> But it had loyally sacrificed itself in a way none could but praise.
<00000076> Indeed, when the late king witnessed that, he lightly clapped his hands and said ‘What a wonderful display of obedience.’
<00000077> 
<00000078> ...I, however, had not shared the late king's feelings.
<00000079> The feeling I'd had was difficult to express, but one of greatest discomfort.

<00000081> 技師「Lord Jussi, over here, if you would.」
<00000082> Beckoned by the doll engineer, I had followed him outside the castle walls, and when he pointed to the fallen creature, I had realized the nature of that feeling.

<00000088> It had lost its right leg below the knee, though the left leg remained intact.
<00000089> Though the length of its legs no longer matched, regardless of that, to fulfill the order from earlier... it began to move again.
<00000090> 
<00000091> Knowing that it could no longer walk, it forsook its lower body and depended on the rest, its hands and fingers outstretched as it sought the pigeon that had flown far away.

<00000094> v31xx0003
<00000095> 技師「―It lives for the sake of its orders.」
<00000096> It was just a doll. What I had felt was not pity at the consequence of its stupidity.
<00000097> It was... fear.
<00000098> Merely because of a order, it would take reckless actions that would cause humans to at least hesitate.

<00000281> v27ha0186
<00000282> ハンス「B-but I can't wait that long.」
<00000283> The high pitch of Hans' voice clearly indicated his anxiousness.
<00000284> v26va0082
<00000285> ヴァレ「(―That is only natural...)」
<00000286> After all, an incident like that had happened.
<00000287> v26va0083
<00000288> ヴァレ「(―Well, the fate he met... was just a matter of sooner or later.)」
<00000289> 
<00000290> 
<00000291> Of course, I couldn't say that in front of Hans, so I kept the thought to myself and just gave him a silent smile.
<00000292> I had no interest in agitating Hans any further than this.
<00000293> v26va0084
<00000294> ヴァレ「...Well, what is it that you want to tell me, then?」
<00000295> v27ha0187

<00000297> v26va0085

<00000299> han_b03
<00000300> v27ha0188
<00000301> ハンス「Ah, yes. My apologies.」
<00000302> His behavior was not intentional... but more due to his way of life.
<00000303> Even though he had status and power, he still engaged in daily interaction with people unworthy of his status, thus being contaminated by their habits.
<00000304> 
<00000305> One such habit was that whenever he felt anxious, he would speak his mind without reserve.
<00000306> 
<00000307> 
<00000308> 
<00000309> v26va0086
<00000310> ヴァレ「(―That's why, I will forgive you for that, Hans.)」
<00000311> You are different from those incompetents.
<00000312> You have the courtesy to apologize for what you did, and reflect on your actions, just as you are doing now.
<00000313> v26va0087
<00000314> ヴァレ「You are speaking of Lord Jussi, right?」
<00000315> han_b06

<00000318> v26va0088
<00000319> ヴァレ「(―Hey, now.)」
<00000320> Why are you getting shaken for? Isn't this what you wanted to talk about?
<00000321> Seizing the initiative and not carelessly surrendering it to one's opponent take is fundamental, right? 
<00000322> 
<00000323> 
<00000324> han_b01
<00000325> v27ha0190
<00000326> ハンス「Lord Valery, what are... your thoughts?」
<00000327> v26va0089
<00000328> ヴァレ「You mean, concerning Lord Jussi's death, right?」
<00000329> v27ha0191
<00000330> ハンス「Yes.」
<00000331> v26va0090
<00000332> ヴァレ「Well, according to the explanation during yesterday's funeral, didn't they say he succumbed to ‘a sudden illness?’」
<00000333> I had never thought that my first task as a new ambassador would be to attend Jussi's state funeral.
<00000334> han_b04
<00000335> v26va0091
<00000336> ヴァレ「Are you unable to accept that?」
<00000337> v27ha0192
<00000338> ハンス「...Did he really die of illness? Could it be that he was involved in some trouble, and...」
<00000339> 
<00000340> 
<00000341> han_b01
<00000342> Hans glanced around to see if anyone else was nearby.
<00000343> v26va0092
<00000344> ヴァレ「(―I see, so he has doubts about Jussi's death.)」
<00000345> Quite perceptive... though I would have liked to praise him, such suspicion came naturally to one in my position.
<00000346> In addition, his suspicion had arisen from his cowardly personality, rather than his rationality.
<00000347> For one, he already had a suspect in mind.
<00000348> And those eyes clouded with fear as he spoke to me was evidence of that. 
<00000349> v26va0093
<00000350> ヴァレ「(―Hmph.)」
<00000351>  He dared not say that he suspected me.
<00000352> I thought that one should at least conceal that kind of expression when conversing, as it would naturally cause difficulty in our relationship... but I wonder if it applies here?
<00000353> v26va0094
<00000354> ヴァレ「It seems hardly possible, but by any chance could it be that you suspect me, Lord Hans?」
<00000355> han_b06
<00000356> v27ha0193
<00000357> ハンス「O-of course not!
<00000358> I would never do such a thing!」
<00000359> The way he denied it so vehemently made it hard for me to contain my laughter.
<00000360> I had hoped his response would be one of simple incredulity, as he feigned his ignorance. 
<00000361> In this conversation, since the question has not yet been raised, he should have said ‘suspecting you of what?’ as the correct reply.
<00000362> If only he would just calm down a little, we could surely regain each other's trust.
<00000363> v26va0095
<00000364> ヴァレ「So you have doubts, Lord Hans.」
<00000365> v27ha0194
<00000366> ハンス「What are you talking about, Lord Valery! If you knew the extent of the faith I have in you...」
<00000367> 
<00000368> v26va0096
<00000369> ヴァレ「There, there, please wait a minute. I speak not of myself... but you feel doubt about the cause of Lord Jussi's death, right?」
<00000370> 
<00000371> han_b03
<00000372> v27ha0195
<00000373> ハンス「......Ah, y-yes.」
<00000374> v26va0097
<00000375> ヴァレ「If so, then I feel the same way too. I cannot accept their claim that such a driven man died of illness so suddenly.」
<00000376> han_b01
<00000377> v27ha0196
<00000378> ハンス「That's right, that's absolutely right.」
<00000379> v26va0098
<00000380> ヴァレ「―Well then, if it was not ‘sudden illness,’ then what was it?」
<00000381> v27ha0197
<00000382> ハンス「...Um...」
<00000383> v26va0099
<00000384> ヴァレ「Perhaps the cause of his death is one that must be hidden no matter what... or something.」
<00000385> han_b03
<00000386> v27ha0198
<00000387> ハンス「...U-um...」
<00000388> v26va0100
<00000389> ヴァレ「It could be that someone did him in or something... hahaha, do I jest too much?」
<00000390> 
<00000391> v27ha0199
<00000392> ハンス「......」
<00000393>  Hans gave no response, his face a most unhealthy color.
<00000394> v26va0101
<00000395> ヴァレ「(―Hey, at least laugh a little with me.)」
<00000396> In conversations, matching one's flow with your opponent is crucial.
<00000397> But since he couldn't do that, I would have to lead him along instead.
<00000398> v26va0102
<00000399> ヴァレ「Whatever the reason, Lord Jussi has already passed away. That, at the least is a fact.」
<00000400> han_b04
<00000401> v27ha0200
<00000402> ハンス「...Yes.」
<00000403> v26va0103
<00000404> ヴァレ「All I can say is that we have lost a person valuable to us... but there might be those with the opposite sentiment.」
<00000405> 
<00000406> The instant he heard my implications, Hans' eyes started swimming.
<00000407> han_b01
<00000408> v27ha0201
<00000409> ハンス「―By ‘opposite,’ you mean?」
<00000410> v26va0104
<00000411> ヴァレ「(―Don't play dumb when you understand what I'm saying.)」
<00000412> Hans was different from Jussi. He uses his head.
<00000413> But, though he has something in the way of intelligence, he is too cowardly to be cunning.
<00000414> He was not brave enough to follow his thoughts to their conclusion.
<00000415> If he could just perceive and understand that about himself and aspire to overcome it, he wouldn't have handled this situation right now so boorishly.
<00000416> v26va0105
<00000417> ヴァレ「Well, he was like a bothersome speck in Ein's eye, so I believe Ein thinks of this incident as conveniently ridding him of a nuisance.」
<00000418> han_b02
<00000419> v27ha0202
<00000420> ハンス「Ah, ooh, I see.」
<00000421> Hans brightened up. It seems that he calmed down after hearing that.
<00000422> For some reason, the way that he honestly agreed with me bothered me.
<00000423> v26va0106
<00000424> ヴァレ「(―Oh well.)」
<00000425> Rather than making demands of him, I decided to use a method with greater subtlety.
<00000426> han_b01
<00000427> This is ideal as a test for Hans, and as a rehearsal before I use it on Ein later.
<00000428> 
<00000429> v26va0107
<00000430> ヴァレ「Nevertheless, Lord Hans. A human's death is not an easy thing to understand.」
<00000431> v27ha0203
<00000432> ハンス「―Yes.」
<00000433> v26va0108
<00000434> ヴァレ「It has been but a week since I met Lord Jussi. I never thought that the wine we drank together- at that time- would be our last.」
<00000435> 
<00000436> 
<00000437> v27ha0204
<00000438> ハンス「...Indeed.」
<00000439> v26va0109

<00000442> ハンス「...?」
<00000443> v26va0110

<00000451> ヴァレ「(―A good answer.)」
<00000452> Looking at his face showed clearly that he understood nothing of what I had said. I smiled in response.
<00000453> v26va0112

<00000460> v26va0114
<00000461> ヴァレ「(―Hans is innocent. He had nothing to do with Jussi's death.)」
<00000462> And there was no sign that Ein had stabbed Jussi in the back, either... for now, that is.
<00000463> What remains is to be cautious, and take care that Ein does not suspect we are the ones who killed Jussi.
<00000464> v26va0115
<00000465> ヴァレ「By the way, this may seem to be a foolish question, but is Lord Ein the man with the long hair?」
<00000466> v27ha0208

<00000532> Dua, whose behavior was much stiffer than Valery's, responded to his greeting after a moment's hesitation.
<00000533> 
<00000534> 
<00000535> As Valery had noted, the two of them had met before.
<00000536> According to her description of the situation at that time, their relationship could be said to have gotten off to a rocky start.

<00000562> As the kingdom established by the peace treaty between the Blue Kingdom and the Red Kingdom, the White Kingdom holds this ceremony for the sake of celebrating the ongoing peace.
<00000563> 
<00000564> The memorial ceremony shall be held in three weeks' time.
<00000565> From the day before until two days after the memorial ceremony, the White Kingdom shall not collect the usual border tolls, and passage in and out of the kingdom shall be allowed freely.
<00000566> 
<00000567> And at the time of the memorial ceremony, in consideration of the problem of insufficient security, we shall be borrowing troops from both the Red and Blue Kingdom.

<00000598> If I carelessly accepted that proposal, the other kingdom would surely insist that they be allowed to do the same... thus, pointless conflict would arise, which I must not let occur.
<00000599> 
<00000600> As the small White Kingdom is surrounded by the other two kingdoms, it is crucial to maintain good relations between those kingdoms to preserve our own security.

<00000610> While the town below the castle holds its superb festival for the occasion, guests from the two kingdoms shall be feasting, conversing and enjoying the numerous entertainments planned within the Dornstein Castle.
<00000611> 
<00000612> 
<00000613> And one of those entertainments is a collaborative theater performance between the three kingdoms, ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings,’ that shall be performed in the court hall before the guests from every kingdom.
<00000614> 
<00000615> The play known as ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ was written as an autobiography by the first queen of the White Kingdom, and its story portrays the vicissitudes of the development of doll arts.
<00000616> 
<00000617> We had thought this play to be perfect for the occasion, but―
<00000618> 
<00000619> 
<00000620> 
<00000621> After we had chosen it, a matter of concern had arisen.
<00000622> And that was that most of the representatives from the two kingdoms which will be attending the memorial ceremony on that day have already seen that play before in the past.
<00000623> 
<00000624> When we were informed of that, the preparations were already well underway... so it would be difficult to change the play to be performed.
<00000625> 
<00000626> In regards to that, the Blue Kingdom had proposed a solution; to spice up our performance by altering a portion of the play's story- that is, make the ending a bolder one.

<00000660> Watching his behavior, Dua narrowed her eyes for an instant, as if to remonstrate our guest's inappropriate manner. 
<00000661> 
<00000662> 
<00000663>

<00000685> アイン「―Well, let's just leave it at that.」
<00000686>  I replied back with words that were neither accusing, nor apologetic.
<00000687> Since he now knew I was aware he was trying to waste my time with his posturing, he should not persist in it.
<00000688> That means, the next thing he will say is―

<00000696> I was thinking of responding diplomatically with a courteous nod, but I paused.
<00000697> In actual fact, Lord Jussi had died from falling down the stairs.
<00000698> ...But at the scene of the event, there had been an open bottle of wine by his side, so to protect the deceased's honorable reputation, we had decided to announce that his death was caused by sudden illness.
<00000699> 
<00000700> 
<00000701> The truth was known only to I, Dua, the coroner, and the Osbourne family.
<00000702> The accident had happened just before the memorial ceremony.

<00000705> アイン「(―Should I be courteous, or should I probe deeper?)」
<00000706> I, too, must be cautious since I have no idea what he plans to say next.

<00000736> On the other hand, Hans was staring straight at Valery, obviously shaken.
<00000737> Bringing up such a dangerous topic of conversation... does he hope to gain something from this?
<00000738> If so, why has he gone out of his way to drag Hans along with him as he jumps into the fire?

<00000740> v24ei0253
<00000741> アイン「(―No.)」
<00000742> The reason he speaks of this so openly must be because he has confidence that Hans will not expose him.

<00000782>  only the coroner and Jussi's relatives, the Osbourne family.
<00000783> Rather than hypothesizing that Valery had somehow convinced the coroner to tell him, it was much more likely he had gotten that information from someone in the Osbourne family.

<00000189> I lifted up the bundle of documents I had finished going through, moved it to the side, then put the pile down on the side of the desk in front of her.
<00000190> Though the papers were a bit big, arranging them should still be possible for her.

<00000207> Unexpectedly, after handing over that work to her, I felt that my own work was going more smoothly.
<00000208> Not wanting to make her wait too long, I browsed through the documents with a much quicker pace than usual.
<00000209> And then, at the moment I passed her the final page...
<00000210> coc_g03
<00000211> v02co0547
<00000212> ココ「What is this―?」
<00000213> I looked at the document I had handed Coco, it was an agreement related to exports.
<00000214> ‘―Agreement Contract for the Delivery Date and Payment of the Export Products―’
<00000215> The contents for this document were on a different level from the planting of potatoes earlier, it was difficult to explain to Coco.
<00000216> Thus, I tried my best to simplify my words and explain to her our trading with Blew.
<00000217> 
<00000218> 
<00000219> v24ei0351a
<00000220> アイン「...This is an evidence of an agreement made that will be kept after the transaction occurs.」
<00000221> After saying that, I observed Coco's reactions.
<00000222> But of course, she only tilted her head. Had I used too many abstract words?

<00000229> 
<00000230> To teach her the meaning of contracts, the fastest way is to show it to her via practical means. Besides, this makes a good break from work.
<00000231> 
<00000232> 
<00000233> With that thought, I brought out a piece of paper, wrote ‘While Ein is holding the pen, I will keep some distance from his desk and go play by myself’, and then showed it to Coco.

<00000267> coc_a01
<00000268> After calling for Coco to come back and sit on her chair, I wrote ‘Coco’ on another piece of paper for her to see.
<00000269> 
<00000270> And then, I passed the pen to her, pointed down at the paper,
<00000271> v24ei0359

<00000273>  and encouraged her to practice.

<00000280> And then, after deciding that the time is ripe, I had her sign the real contract document.

<00002063> Just a few minutes before the rehearsal of ‘Spreading of the Angel's Wings’ was to begin, Dua had finally reported her arrival.

<00002070> There was an audience of about thirty in this hall, the venue for the play.
<00002071> According to the plan, there will be a slightly larger audience in attendance at the real performance, so we had placed the approximate number of seats in consideration of that.
<00002072> Furthermore, in case anything unexpected were to happen, there were ten guards stationed around here, not counting Dua.
<00002073> The flow of the rehearsal today will be exactly in line with the actual performance, so these guards are expected to be deployed the same way on that day as they are now.
<00002074> v24ei0368
<00002075> アイン「(―Still...)」
<00002076> Regrettably, not all the guards are from our kingdom, some of them are on loan from the other kingdoms... so I couldn't regard this as thoroughly secure.
<00002077> As well as four soldiers from our White Kingdom, there were three each from the Red and Blue, so this was hardly an advantageous situation for us. 
<00002078> 
<00002079> Furthermore, as the majority of the important personages of the White Kingdom gathered in, the security elsewhere in the castle is lax.
<00002080> 
<00002081> Seeing that we will have to assign bodyguards to these personages during the actual performance, we might have just enough guards to retain our usual level of security throughout the whole castle.

<00002084> v24ei0369
<00002085> アイン「(―And that in itself is just barely enough...)」
<00002086> No matter where inside the castle, we must have the highest of guards deployed in that area be from the White Kingdom- in short, our reliance upon the aid of the other kingdoms must not surpass half from either kingdom.
<00002087> 
<00002088> 
<00002089> Still, no matter how skillful our commanders in each of their designated areas are, whether the other kingdom's soldiers will follow their orders obediently is another matter.
<00002090> Even if those foreign soldiers do not mention it, there are no doubt quite a few of them that feel a sense of humiliation being under the command of a small kingdom such as ours.
<00002091> 
<00002092> 
<00002093> It's questionable whether we could effectively utilize their power when the crucial time comes, as they would be no different from an unorganized mob.

<00002114> 
<00002115> What I had was only the summary of the play's flow, and the timing schedule of the use of the various stage tools and lighting.

<00002824> 
<00002825> But I had no idea why Efa looked as if she was suffering so.
<00002826> I was not one to judge, I myself could not say that final line either―
<00002827> black450
<00002828> Feeling miserable for myself, I couldn't meet Efa's eyes, and avoided her stare by glancing into the audience.

<00002831> My sight was attracted to the Blue Ambassador, Valery.

<00002834> He, and only he, wore an expression different from the rest of the audience.

<00000015> I received news of a death this morning.
<00000016> The former foreign minister, Lord Jussi, had suddenly passed away.
<00000017> I couldn't believe it. When I had met him the morning yesterday, not only did he look in fine health, he was even full of spirit.
<00000018> 
<00000019> I was told that the cause of death had been ‘sickness.’
<00000020> I prayed that his soul would rest in peace, and took upon myself his dying wishes for the sake of the kingdom that was his home.
<00000021> 
<00000022> 16.10.18
<00000023> After the official declaration that Lord Jussi had passed away from sickness, some rumors arose.
<00000024> 
<00000025> The most terrifying one was that he had died from a virulent plague, but the coroner had denied that from the beginning.
<00000026> 
<00000027> 
<00000028> If it were something as dreadful as that,
<00000029> 
<00000030> they would surely plan to cremate him. ...Therefore, it is unthinkable that he had died from a contagious disease.
<00000031> Many other rumors claim that he perished not from sickness, but from...
<00000032> No, I have no need to write these down here.
<00000033> 
<00000034> That will be all for today.
<00000035> 17.10.18
<00000036> After the funeral, I went and inquired about Lord Jussi's demise from several servants I knew in the Osborne Mansion.
<00000037> 
<00000038> Shockingly, I learned that there had been only one man at his side when he passed away. The other servants didn't even know which disease had struck him down, only that he had died in the evening.
<00000039> 
<00000040> 
<00000041> 
<00000042> 
<00000043> I was told by the head butler that the man who had stayed beside Lord Jussi in his final moments had suffered greatly from the shock of his master's death, and taken leave from the mansion to recuperate.
<00000044> 
<00000045> 
<00000046> 
<00000047> 
<00000048> It seemed that man had been Lord Jussi's carriage driver.
<00000049> 
<00000050> 
<00000051> Where he had gone after leaving the mansion... the head butler did not know. 
<00000052> The man had watched Lord Jussi until his last moments, but left the mansion without even attending the funeral...
<00000053> ―What does this mean?
<00000054> 18.10.18
<00000055> I must be careful upon Dornstein Castle's staircases.
<00000056> If one were to carelessly slip and fall, they would no doubt have a sprain to show for it.
<00000057> The doctor's fee for the examination would be 10 or 14.
<00000058> But it might eventually be more expensive than that.

<00000060> My appetite has been decreasing recently.
<00000061> I wonder if my condition will settle down by next month?

<00000064> Some wine is expected to arrive for the upcoming memorial ceremony.
<00000065> 
<00000066> 
<00000067> The person who ordered it is the Blue Ambassador, Lord Valery.
<00000068> I'll have to sign for receipt of the package, make some arrangements for it on the morning of the ceremony day and then our troubles will be over. I don't know much about wine, so I wish I could just leave these kinds of things to Lord Valery.

<00000074> As the day of the rehearsal ceremony approaches, my unease has gradually been increasing.
<00000075> Will my preparations be free of any problems?
<00000076> If I have made a mistake, then our plan will evaporate into thin air.
<00000077> 
<00000078> 2J check, end distribution status is C1 and E1.
<00000079> Passed J to E through C, C done.
<00000080> Retrieved J from C. J in E remains as is.
<00000081> 25.10.18 (re-entry)
<00000082> This is a supplement to my entries dated the 24th and 25th. 
<00000083> When I tore out a page of the diary for C, I forgot that I had written on the page already, so this entry spans two days. I was filled with regret upon realizing my mistake, as I hadn't at the time when I retrieved C's J.
<00000084> 
<00000085> 
<00000086> 
<00000087> 
<00000088> ...But fortunately, I don't remember writing anything suspicious on it. Now, my preparations are complete.
<00000089> 
<00000090> 
<00000091> ...All that remains is to pray that the rehearsal ceremony goes smoothly.

<00000105> A proposed conference between the three kingdoms.
<00000106> Ein was the one that had suggested it, and it was just what I had expected to happen.
<00000107> v26va0277

<00000114> From the White Kingdom's point of view, the head representative from the Red is probably nothing but a decoration, a prop used in order that they can call the meeting a ‘conference between the three kingdoms’. 
<00000115> 
<00000116>

<00000120> ヴァレ「(―If my plan is exposed, that is.)」
<00000121> If one were to place Blew and Cardinal on a scale, and weigh which of them is the more suspicious... the scale would doubtless tip towards to our side. 
<00000122> 
<00000123> And that is only natural.
<00000124> Since the day our discussion had been overheard by Dua, I had definitely already been under suspicion.
<00000125> Claiming that I wanted to bring home some wine whose export was forbidden... there's no way child's play like that would fool them so easily.
<00000126> 
<00000127> Indeed, I had already known it wouldn't work. That trick just lets them know I have some cards hidden.

<00000135> ヴァレ「(―Still, how pitiful.)」
<00000136> This weak and miniscule kingdom whose only strength is their Doll Arts, that is. Their survival depends on the mood of their progenitors, Blew and Cardinal, and they must constantly negotiate their continued existence.
<00000137> 
<00000138> They cannot take sides, nor can they escape their influence.
<00000139> If they grow too close to one kingdom, it will definitely damage the relationship with the other.

<00000142> ヴァレ「(―As if resting upon a bed of needles.)」
<00000143> To maintain this balance of power throughout the generations, Weiss has always avoided royal marriages with the Red and Blue, and picked their consorts from their own kingdom, but―
<00000144> 
<00000145> 
<00000146> 
<00000147> 
<00000148> 
<00000149> The late king's queen had died of illness several years after giving birth to their only child, Christina.
<00000150> Some time after the period of mourning had ended, both the Blue and the Red had proposed candidates from their own kingdoms to be the king's next consort.

<00000161> If that were not the case, he wouldn't have passed away without leaving a male heir to the throne.
<00000162> bg52a01
<00000163> v26va0285
<00000164> ヴァレ「How pitiful.」
<00000165> Since this kingdom has had a policy of hereditary succession since its creation, a collateral relative can never become a legitimate heir. 
<00000166> 
<00000167> 
<00000168> 
<00000169> Thus the burden of rulership was forced onto Christina's shoulders.

<00000171> ヴァレ「(―If they had been willing to accept a monarch in name alone rather than in blood, then anyone would have sufficed.)」

<00000173> v26va0287
<00000174> ヴァレ「(―And that is the inheritance of the Doll Arts.)」
<00000175> Each and every ruler of Weiss throughout the generations have had their own talents, but despite that, they were all able to master the most modern of Doll Arts that existed in their era.
<00000176> 
<00000177> ...Moreover, their skills would reach the level of the previous ruler's in an exceptionally short time.
<00000178> And that is not something that can be achieved just by reading books or having an excellent teacher.
<00000179> If so, how did they accomplish that?
<00000180> The answer for that is none other than the gem that possesses the sum of the Doll Arts that have been passed down from generation to generation - the ‘Dorn's Memory’.
<00000181> 
<00000182> 
<00000183> v26va0288
<00000184> ヴァレ「(―The gem through which even human memories can be inherited.)」
<00000185> The Dorn family has incorporated some tricks into the ‘Dorn's Memory’ as insurance, ensuring that only their direct descendants are able to utilize it.
<00000186> 
<00000187> That was as if a curse tailored especially for the Blue and Red Kingdom.

<00000190> v26va0289
<00000191> ヴァレ「(―They didn't want to surrender the essence of their Doll Arts to either side.)」
<00000192> Even if the Red or Blue were to obtain it by force, they still would not be able to witness its contents... it would be nothing more than an ordinary stone.
<00000193> 
<00000194> Nobody would be pleased at acquiring a worthless stone.

<00000198> 
<00000199> Just because she possess the blood of Dorn, she will be forced to succeed the throne... a deplorable situation. 
<00000200> As a foreign officer from a neighboring kingdom, I believed things would be easier if she were to quickly find a consort.

<00000207> ヴァレ「(―That he's waiting for an appropriate time to become monarch himself?)」
<00000208> Rebellion from within requires quite some preparation, and Ein is certainly of noble enough blood to make himself king.
<00000209> 
<00000210> Even if the steward that has always supported the Princess behind her were to step forward and stand beside her in status, the one in charge of diplomacy with the other kingdoms will not change.

<00000790> I was summoned for the conference between the three kingdoms.

<00000796> So as not to interact with him within the castle grounds, I decided to wait outside the gate for him- thus the reason I stationed myself in such a secluded place. 
<00000797> 
<00000798> But the scheduled time was near and I still hadn't seen Lord Valery's carriage arrive.
<00000799> After asking the gate guard out of anxiety, I found out that he had already gone inside around an hour ago.
<00000800> 
<00000801> Isn't that as if he arrived without the knowledge that the time of the conference had changed!?

<00000020> And those in attendance were the same as well - the head representative from the Red, and the Blue Ambassador.
<00000021> Just like yesterday, Dua did not attend.

<00000023> But there was one more person who would definitely not be coming.

<00000025> v24ei0467
<00000026> アイン「(―Hans.)」
<00000027> I had announced that this conference would concern the assassination attempt on Princess Christina during the rehearsal for the memorial ceremony... a discussion of the true identity of the hooded man.
<00000028> But in truth, our true purpose was to uncover the mastermind who had planned the incident.

<00000031> アイン「(―I have no evidence, but I know the one pulling the strings is Valery.)」
<00000032> The Blue Ambassador is a cautious man who leaves few traces of his handiwork- thus I could only investigate Hans and Jussi.
<00000033> I had discovered that the dagger Efa had used on stage had been tampered with.
<00000034> Fortunately, I was able to obtain evidence of that, but―
<00000035> ein_d06
<00000036> v24ei0469
<00000037> アイン「(―I was too careless in the end.)」
<00000038> Yesterday evening, Hans had escaped from Dua's interrogation in the hallway near the dining hall.
<00000039> The gate guards had not seen him leave the castle- thus we searched every single corner, but he was nowhere to be found. 
<00000040> I had sent some guards to Hans' home just in case, and found that he hadn't gone back there either.
<00000041> When it grew late, the search became difficult, so I called a halt to it and intended to continue it today.
<00000042> ...However.
<00000043> This morning, I received a report from a servant in Hans' home, informing me that his master was found lying down in the living room and soon confirmed to be dead.
<00000044> ein_d07
<00000045> v24ei0470
<00000046> アイン「(―Now I've no one to extract information from...)」
<00000047> According to the coroner, there was evidence that Hans had been clutching his throat.
<00000048> 
<00000049> It was a symptom similar to that of the poison used by the man who had attacked the Princess at the rehearsal.
<00000050> 
<00000051> 
<00000052> The reason why I couldn't be sure is because the coroner's report stated that these were the only two examples of such a death in our kingdom's history, so the poison's characteristics were difficult to identify.

<00000059> It was possible he had deliberately poisoned himself, but in the end, the result was the same.
<00000060> 
<00000061> 
<00000062> 
<00000063> The mastermind in the shadows... had successfully covered his trail.
<00000064> v24ei0472
<00000065> アイン「(―In addition...)」
<00000066> The true mastermind can now claim that Hans was behind everything to buy time for his own escape.

<00000077> 団長「...Cardinal, too, cannot disregard that possibility.」

<00000081> bg58a01
<00000082> v24ei0473
<00000083> アイン「(―This completely backfired on me.)」
<00000084> Yesterday, after summoning the representatives for the conference, I lied to Hans that the meeting time had changed so that I could separate him from Valery.
<00000085> 
<00000086> And then, taking advantage of his lack of bodyguards within the castle grounds, I sent Dua to trick him into confessing, then bring him to the conference... that was what I had planned.
<00000087> 
<00000088> My own business went quite smoothly. As I had agreed upon with the head representative from the Red Kingdom, we began the conference with complete disregard for whatever Valery had to say.
<00000089> 
<00000090> black450
<00000091> Still, just as things were going to the right direction, the witness that should have appeared made his escape...

<00000096> The dead cannot speak.
<00000097> They'll let Hans take the blame, then deny that their kingdoms were involved in or even knew of the plot.
<00000098> Not only Valery of Blew, but the representative from the Cardinal had also received orders from above to keep silent.

<00000101> v24ei0475
<00000102> アイン「(―Considering her standpoint, that is only natural.)」
<00000103> As she is the official head representative from Cardinal, rather than taking my side for no reason, it's more likely that she will agree with Blew.

<00000111> Though she had been cooperative at yesterday's conference, I couldn't be sure that she was still willing to help me.
<00000112> 
<00000113> bg58a01
<00000114> I could only blame my failure upon my own naivete.

<00000120> ヴァレ「―We would like to know what measures you plan to take in the meantime.」
<00000121> 
<00000122> Valery shot a glance at the Red representative, then slowly returned his eyes to me.
<00000123> There was no hint of sarcasm upon his face- he spoke as if it were the most natural thing for him as an ambassador, as if he were wearing a mask. 
<00000124> If the triumph he must be feeling at this moment were evident in his voice, that would make it easy for me... however, I cannot expect him to act so rashly. 
<00000125> bg58a01
<00000126> v24ei0476
<00000127> アイン「(―Then, what shall be our move...)」
<00000128> I know not what cards Valery still has up his sleeve. Taking any large risks would be inadvisable.
<00000129> In addition, making a move without the support of the Red representative would be like stepping into a battleground with no chance of victory.
<00000130> If I should say something careless out of exasperation, not only the Princess but even our citizens will become embroiled in this.

<00000177> 団長「...Then we shall immediately begin preparing to bring our national treasure Efa back with us.」

<00000185> v29da0065
<00000186> 団長「―No, if our representatives shall be returning, then our plans have changed. If the opening of the ceremony is to be delayed, it is logical that we take her with us and repair her in Cardinal... don't you agree, Lord Ein?」
<00000187> 
<00000188> 
<00000189> v24ei0484
<00000190> アイン「(―I can't say anything back to that.)」
<00000191> Even I agreed that there was no need to leave Efa in Weiss for repairs alone.
<00000192> And I definitely wouldn't want any further commotion to arise, on top of that which already has.
<00000193> But still, if Efa is to go back to her own kingdom―

<00000227> During negotiations, the act of compromise is important.
<00000228> If I had said ‘two days later,’ straight away, I had a feeling she would include this day and say ‘We shall leave tomorrow, then,’- thus I added the phrase ‘excluding today.’

<00000022> 団長「No, you have mine as well. I could not decide whether I should request an audience with you.」
<00000023> As I looked at the woman before me, who had just arrived in this audience hall, I recalled our meeting a few days ago in my office.
<00000024> 
<00000025> 
<00000026> 
<00000027> v24ei0522
<00000028> アイン「(―The meeting we had before the three kingdoms' conference, that is.)」
<00000029> It was quite an unpleasant memory. How fine it would be if I could turn the clock back and return to that moment.

<00000035> 団長「Fortunately, I was injured only lightly, so do not worry about me.」
<00000036> Though the head representative's voice was firm, in contrast to her words, I could feel the pain within them. 
<00000037> Originally, she would have been freed of the burden of ‘head representative’ when she got back to her kingdom, but instead, here she is in Dornstein Castle once more. 
<00000038> Well, it could have been much worse.
<00000039> 
<00000040> After all, she was among the group of representatives that was attacked near the Red Kingdom's border.
<00000041> In the chaos, she lost her senses, fainted, and was later saved by the border guards from the White Kingdom when they arrived.
<00000042> 
<00000043> As the sole survivor, she had come to hate the outdoors- thus why our meeting right now was being held in the audience hall, whose only windows look on the courtyard.
<00000044>

<00000049> 団長「Lord Ein. Your kindness is appreciated, but I do not intend to stay here for long.」
<00000050> Her manner of speaking, curt and swift, certainly hasn't changed.
<00000051> v24ei0525

<00000055> 団長「Enough about me, I'm worried about Efa... is our national treasure safe?」
<00000056> 
<00000057> The impatient tuner brushed aside my concern for her and, as was her duty, inquired about Efa instead.
<00000058> 
<00000059> v24ei0526
<00000060> アイン「―Yes, she is fine.」
<00000061> Since Efa wasn't human, I hadn't counted her as a survivor when I had noted that the head representative was the sole survivor.
<00000062> Excluding her, there had been a total of twenty-one deaths among the representatives and the bodyguards that were to escort them back to their kingdom.

<00000073> 団長「...However, before that there are matters we must resolve, I believe.」
<00000074>  she sighed and dropped her head immediately after.
<00000075> As expected of the head of the representatives, she understood that she couldn't just return home and leave the matter of our foreign affairs unsolved.
<00000076> v24ei0528
<00000077> アイン「Then, please come over here.」
<00000078> rmsg_a01
<00000079> This time, she did not decline my proposal that she take a seat, and did so silently. I brought out the documents I had at hand, and began asking questions.
<00000080> 
<00000081> v24ei0529
<00000082> アイン「First of all, regarding the attack on the group of representatives...」
<00000083> The location of the incident was an unstable locale near the kingdoms' border. Nominally, it was under Weiss's jurisdiction.
<00000084> 
<00000085> 
<00000086> Thus, naturally, we will be unable to avoid blame for the incident.
<00000087> However, the group of representatives had officially declared that they needed no guards from Weiss to escort them. 
<00000088> 
<00000089> 
<00000090> I regretted not insisting that we should detail soldiers to escort them, regardless of their wishes.

<00000100> 団長「―I was overconfident that we would safely meet with our border guards on our trip back.」
<00000101> Though the security near the borders had been maintained until now, due to the tension between our two kingdoms, the cooperation between our garrisons was hindered and we had been late in responding to the attack.
<00000102> 
<00000103>

<00000112> v29da0081
<00000113> 団長「Yes... do you mean...」

<00000136> アイン「The evidence is that according to Efa's testimony―」
<00000137> v24ei0538
<00000138> アイン「When Dua arrived on the scene, took Efa and tried to escape, the bandits still chased after them.」
<00000139> v24ei0539
<00000140> アイン「If they were but petty robbers, that they would have decided to pursue them after witnessing Dua's swordsmanship... I find that hard to believe.」
<00000141> rmsg_a01
<00000142> v29da0085
<00000143> 団長「―What if they believed Efa was of great value?」
<00000144> v24ei0540
<00000145> アイン「Yes, that is possible, since they would have recognized Efa as a doll from her wing.」
<00000146> 
<00000147> v24ei0541
<00000148> アイン「...However, I do not believe that they would be so tenacious as to gamble their lives against a swordsman just for the sake of taking her.」
<00000149> rmsg_a02
<00000150> v29da0086
<00000151> 団長「So you're saying that judging from the risks those bandits were willing to take to get her, their target was Efa from the very beginning, yes?」
<00000152> 
<00000153> v24ei0542
<00000154> アイン「Yes. Of course, there is the possibility that that might not be the reason and they pursued her merely as a target of opportunity.」
<00000155> v24ei0543
<00000156> アイン「However, though Efa's unparalleled design is apparent even to the eyes of amateurs, if there were no one to fence her to... then she is naught but a piece of wood.」

<00000161> Was she displeased by what I had said? Her expression had soured slightly...

<00000163> rmsg_a01
<00000164> v29da0087

<00000174> アイン「I doubt any would expect to find a buyer for the Red Kingdom's treasure. Withal, if they escaped with a doll of such value, the kingdoms would surely wager their dignity upon an all-out manhunt.」

<00000408> At the three kingdoms' conference, Ein had set me up fairly well, and I was on edge.
<00000409> 
<00000410> 
<00000411> Not only had he managed to avert the declaration of war, my plan had been in danger of being completely exposed by Hans.
<00000412> ...However, I was still residing in this castle in the role of an ambassador, so dealing with that situation was within my means.

<00000460> Unlike Jussi, I had met him in the Blue Kingdom, and he made a much more suitable subordinate than had Jussi.

<00000500> 
<00000501>

<00000545>

<00000119> Still, the person from the troupe had told me that I wouldn't need to shout his name.
<00000120> 
<00000121> 
<00000122> He said that I just have to look for a conspicuously dressed person.

<00000124> With that in mind, I looked carefully around the dimly lit restaurant.

<00000131> Rather, if this weren't Fabio, then who else could be?
<00000132> 
<00000133> That seat was obviously surrounded by a different atmosphere than the rest.
<00000134> After taking a deep breath, I approached that person who might be Mr. Fabio, summoned my courage and spoke to him.

<00000147> 劇仲間「Yes, this here is Fabio. And you are?」

<00000159> ev027h
<00000160> Though he'd invited me to sit with them, it didn't help to put me at ease at all.
<00000161> But the woman beside him was smiling, as if she found me interesting.

<00000184> 
<00000185> I wasn't used to using that word, so it felt a little strange.
<00000186>  But when talking to stage performers, they're more likely to understand that, I guess?

<00000213> As if she couldn't stand just eavesdropping, the woman joined in our conversation.

<00000222> 
<00000223> 
<00000224> After saying that in a teasing tone of voice and winking at me, she turned towards Mr. Fabio.
<00000225> 
<00000226> ev027k
<00000227> v45xx0005
<00000228> 劇仲間「This person always gets excited when he hears something that interests him, so it's pretty dangerous,」

<00000242> If this goes on, there would be no opportunity left for me to talk,
<00000243> v04ce0980
<00000244> セロ「I'm not here to steal anyone, or anything outrageous like that―」
<00000245>  ...and so, I took a deep breath and told them what I was there for.
<00000246> v09fa0053
<00000247> ファビ「...Oh, the theater festival in Moosgrun, eh?」
<00000248> v04ce0981
<00000249> セロ「...Yes.」
<00000250> In the worst case scenario, he would have declined the moment I asked him, so I was already satisfied that he was willing to hear me out.
<00000251> 
<00000252> ...No, I can't settle for that. My goal is to get Mr. Fabio to perform for us.
<00000253> 
<00000254> v09fa0054
<00000255> ファビ「Hmm. So, what kind of play is it?」
<00000256> v04ce0982

<00000260> v04ce0983
<00000261> セロ「How should I say it, it's a little odd...」
<00000262> I showed him part of the script Wakaba had given me, and waited for his reaction.

<00000269> v45xx0007
<00000270> 劇仲間「What, what?
<00000271> Let me see it too.」
<00000272> ev027d
<00000273> While the woman beside him perused the script as well, Mr. Fabio seemed to be deep in thought.
<00000274> black450
<00000275> ev027b
<00000276> v09fa0057
<00000277> ファビ「...Ein not the villain, eh...」
<00000278> That was the main problem.
<00000279> Even though Ein wasn't the villain, would he still be willing to accept that role?
<00000280> Wakaba had said that Ein still would appear a villain at first, but I don't think Fabio would accept the role just because of that.
<00000281> 
<00000282> In a way, this is almost like tricking him into joining us.
<00000283> v09fa0058
<00000284> ファビ「So, Valery would be the villain, eh?」
<00000285> His reaction didn't seem bad. Still, that doesn't mean that he'll accept.
<00000286> 
<00000287> v09fa0059
<00000288> ファビ「This seems interesting, but... give me sixty seconds to think about it.」
<00000289> ...Sixty seconds?
<00000290>  Was this something that he could decide upon in such a short time?
<00000291> I got nervous.
<00000292>  What should I do if he refuses...
<00000293> With that in mind, I noticed the letter of introduction sticking out from the bag that I had opened to get out the script.
<00000294> 
<00000295> (―No, I should only show it to him if he refuses.)
<00000296> 「E-excuse me... could you take a look at this?」

<00000305> v04ce0985
<00000306> セロ「I believe you will know when you see it.」
<00000307> After all, to tell him that it was a letter of introduction after all I'd said would be bizarre. The important thing is that he looks at it.

<00000508> v00an1227
<00000509> アンジ「...Hm, hmmm...」
<00000510> She's talking as if she understands our relationship perfectly... that annoyed me a little, but I had to put up with it.
<00000511> As she put it, our acting lacked the impression that the hearts of Christina and the Schwester had joined.

<00000527> ...Suddenly, at this moment, I thought I felt someone's eyes upon me.

<00000529> v00an1231
<00000530> アンジ「(―Who can it be?)」
<00000531> I glanced at the audience seating, and saw that though they had been empty before, someone was sitting in one.

<00000534> アンジ「(―That person's...)」
<00000535> The backlight was upon me, so I couldn't really see the audience clearly.
<00000536> I thought of focusing on my acting and continuing to practice, but somehow I was curious.
<00000537>  So, after squinting... I could finally vaguely tell who that person was.

<00000561> I hadn't been able to confess to Lady Marion on that day in the Blue Capital, because I found out that she was already engaged to him.

<00000577> アンジ「(―Wakaba... knows Fabio!?)」
<00000578> Just what kind of relationship do they have?

<00000593> It's impossible for me not to wonder what this is about.
<00000594> Aware that we couldn't concentrate on the rehearsal anymore, Belle and I walked down from the stage together and joined them.

<00000623> I wonder what she told him about me?
<00000624> ...I had no idea.
<00000625> I wasn't sure if I should ask him about it... but in the end, I lost to my curiosity.

<00000005> When Christina Dorn had succeeded the throne, I had begun serving the young Princess as her steward.
<00000006> The Dorn family was formed from the marriage of the Red and Blue nobility, and the royalty of this country shouldered the responsibility of lineal succession.
<00000007> There were two reasons for that.
<00000008> The first was that as a prestigious royal family, they must continue to be of the blood of both Red and Blue, and remain a symbol of peace between the two greater kingdoms. 
<00000009> 
<00000010> While the second was―

<00000014> 
<00000015> That is the ‘Dorn's Memory’ that is renowned within the kingdom, the gem upon the pendant that the Princess wears at all times.

<00000031> v21cr0980
<00000032> クリス「Do you think that I, as a tuner, could do something like that?」
<00000033> Setting aside the matter of the Princess's emotions and rationality at that time, it is true abandoning Efa's treatment was definitely not an option to the White Kingdom.
<00000034> 
<00000035> ...Still, by doing nothing and letting the Red Kingdom's ‘Memory Stealer’ gem carry out its plot to duplicate our kingdom's treasure, she has blundered greatly.
<00000036> 
<00000037> Though I wanted to scold the Princess harshly for what she had done, there was no way I could turn back the clock.

<00000040> chr_a06
<00000041> v21cr0981
<00000042> クリス「―You're right.」
<00000043> The more she longed for Efa, the more memories the gem within Efa would take from her.
<00000044> 
<00000045> ...No, implying that the memories are being stolen is incorrect.
<00000046> This process was more similar to replication of memories, in which the gem would copy the information and record it within itself.
<00000047> 
<00000048> Thus, the normal solution for this problem would simply be to remove the gem from Efa's body, but there was one major complication.
<00000049> 
<00000050> During the Lady's tuning, she had realized that Efa's own spirit- originally resident only in her Memory Stone- was now dependent on the Memory Stealer hidden within her shoes.
<00000051> 
<00000052> After losing her wing, Efa began functioning in such a way that her Memory Stone functions require both of those gemstones to be present- therefore separating the two would be no simple task.
<00000053> 
<00000054> v24ei0753
<00000055> アイン「...Should we return Efa to the Red Kingdom like this?」
<00000056> I suggested to the Lady that we give up doing anything to retrieve the fraction of her memories that had been stolen.
<00000057> chr_a04
<00000058> v21cr0982
<00000059> クリス「As I said earlier, if we let Efa go back as she currently is, it is inevitable that she will cease to function.」
<00000060> 
<00000061> That should be the Red Kingdom's own responsibility. They are the ones who caused this, so it is only proper they should suffer the loss of their kingdom's treasure.
<00000062> 
<00000063> 
<00000064> 
<00000065> Still, it was naive to think the Red Kingdom would be anything but deaf to that logic if the matter escalated.

<00000077> 
<00000078> Judging from the Lady's expression, it seemed like this would be a difficult operation.
<00000079> To succeed, she would have to have a clear understanding of Efa's spiritual structure, and seal off all those memories from their very origin.

<00000173> Of course, that went for all of the king's retainers too.
<00000174> So as not to let down the anticipation given to her by everyone around her, she took the initiative and kept on tuning Giselle.

<00000060> Could it be that I'm the one with a fever instead?
<00000061> No, that can't be right. She was the one who told me that her body seemed unwell.
<00000062> Thus, as if searching for a reason to justify my excuse, my hands roamed Efa's body, searching for a place where she was warmer than I.

<00000101> Understanding what I meant with just that, Efa silently closed her eyes.

<00000144> I never imagined how pleasant it could feel, just to have her brush my hair.

<00000150> For the sake of explaining to Efa, who was looking at me with a worried expression,

<00000152> v21cr1148
<00000153> クリス「I'm sure you'll understand if I do this.」
<00000154> I slid my fingers behind Efa's ears, and pressed them against the back of her neck softly.
<00000155> black450
<00000156> And then, gently and carefully so as not to tug upon the hair between my fingers, I stroked her.

<00000167> As she shook her head in satisfaction, I silently moved my face closer to hers,

<00000188> Overjoyed by Efa's reaction, I hugged her tightly.

<00000064> Being with her puts my heart at rest.
<00000065> ...And she too desires me, the same way I do her.
<00000066> It's not that I have forgotten my initial purpose. 
<00000067> I want to save Efa, no matter what the cost!

<00000192> Cero saw me naked, and I even had to drag him into the bathtub with me... of course I wouldn't be able to forget about that even if I wanted to!
<00000193> 
<00000194> But talking about that won't change the past. What's important is the future.

<00000198> It isn't very considerate of him, but I can take advantage of this.

<00000207> As I looked at Cero with eyes full of anticipation, he nodded in acceptance.
<00000208> Since he's already agreed, I won't need to hold back.
<00000209> I scanned our surroundings, and pointed to a large tree beside the castle wall.

<00000224> My plan was simple.
<00000225> sv019a
<00000226> I'd found the spot closest to the top of the castle wall during the afternoon: a nearby tree one could use to climb up.
<00000227> 
<00000228> In addition, the tree was very close to the wall.
<00000229> So, what do I do? ...I'm sure there was no need to question further.

<00000286> 
<00000287> Originally, I had wanted to slip inside and look around.
<00000288> But there's probably a security alarm inside, so I had better not be that rash.

<00000308> If he leaves me here alone, how am I going to get down from here?
<00000309>  It seems like I have to do the opposite of how I got up here, and jump back to the tree.
<00000310> ...But it's really high, and really dark. If no one is here to help me, I probably can't do it.

<00000329> Since it's turned out like this, I have no choice but to seriously think about what I should do.
<00000330> 
<00000331> Somehow, I have to find a way to get down from here!
<00000332> st03_c06
<00000333> Jumping to the tree is too dangerous. ...Then, what should I do?
<00000334> First, I thought about circling the castle wall until I reached the gate. There should be stairs to get down leading into the insides of the castle.
<00000335> 
<00000336> st03_c03
<00000337> But I'll still be trapped inside the castle without any way out.

<00000361> Cero silently pointed underneath the tree and then shifted his finger to me.

<00000160> ワカバ「...Ugh.」
<00000161>  Wakaba couldn't think of a retort.
<00000162>  How did Silvia know about our problem?
<00000163> Her explanation for that was simple.
<00000164> She'd spotted some familiar faces, namely Cero and Light, and greeted them. They had told her about the problem regarding Wakaba's draft... but at the hotel,

<00000031>  It seemed she remembered both of them.
<00000032> 
<00000033> But why are Silvia and Tonino bringing Coco and Light?
<00000034> Having spoken to Light on the phone, Wakaba was able to explain why they made such an offer.
<00000035> 
<00000036> The two of them said that they were grateful we'd forgiven them, so in return, they're going to drive Coco and Light over here.
<00000037> 
<00000038> 
<00000039> But the details hadn't been settled yet, so we needed to wait for them to phone again.

<00000286> She nodded casually, agreeing with herself. What an easygoing person...
<00000287> 
<00000288> v00an0806
<00000289> アンジ「(―Well, that's natural.)」
<00000290> Since Silvia hasn't been traveling with us for long, she wasn't really one of us.
<00000291> 
<00000292> Even though she seemed to be thankful for how we'd helped her in the past, and was now eager to repay us, that doesn't mean we should see her as a member of our troupe.
<00000293> 
<00000294> 
<00000295> v06si0339
<00000296> シルヴ「Still, sorry to trouble you guys. It's the first time I've been on a sleeping train.」
<00000297> 
<00000298> ...Rather, I should say that her flippancy was irritating me.
<00000299> st06_a00
<00000300> v06si0340
<00000301> シルヴ「I'm sorry, but let me hang out with you guys until we meet up with Tonino.」
<00000302> v00an0807
<00000303> アンジ「...Yeah, yeah. Not like we have a choice.」
<00000304> st06_a05
<00000305> I said that to her bluntly, and she blinked in response.
<00000306> st06_a01
<00000307> v06si0341
<00000308> シルヴ「In exchange, I'll repay you guys for the kindness you showed us in the past,」
<00000309>  she said.
<00000310> I was thinking of stopping her before she took things too far, but―
<00000311> st06_a00
<00000312> v06si0342
<00000313> シルヴ「...Hmm, how about I start with you?」
<00000314> black450
<00000315> v00an0808
<00000316> アンジ「...Wha, what are you doing!?」
<00000317> By the time I realized what was going on, she'd already pulled me into one of the village's shops.
<00000318> 
<00000319> ev017g
<00000320> v06si0343
<00000321> シルヴ「...In the past, Chrome was a mining village.」
<00000322> v06si0344
<00000323> シルヴ「That's why we're able to find such quality Drops here.」
<00000324> 
<00000325> 
<00000326> Silvia had dragged me into this shop, whose inside seemed to exist in a different world from its exterior, under the pretense of wanting to ‘repay my kindness.’
<00000327> 
<00000328> ev017a
<00000329> v00an0809
<00000330> アンジ「...Amazing...」
<00000331> The small shop was full of gems and miniature dolls, the like of which I'd never seen before.
<00000332> 
<00000333> v00an0810
<00000334> アンジ「...It's just a mining village, but there are so many.」
<00000335> v06si0345
<00000336> シルヴ「Even though the amount mined nowadays isn't as much as it used to be, it's enough for me.」
<00000337> 
<00000338> Silvia glanced at me and lightly shook her head.
<00000339> ev017e
<00000340> v06si0346
<00000341> シルヴ「...Sadly, the art of doll engineering has fallen out of fashion. It's only natural that they want to balance supply with demand.」
<00000342> 
<00000343> v00an0811
<00000344> アンジ「...Silvia...」
<00000345> From the side of her face, I could see her displeasure with the state of things.
<00000346> ev017h
<00000347> v00an0812
<00000348> アンジ「By the way, why did you bring me here?」
<00000349> ev017i
<00000350> v06si0347
<00000351> シルヴ「...Hm?
<00000352> Ah, I heard about it in the train. You guys are going to perform a play, right?」
<00000353> 
<00000354> v00an0813
<00000355> アンジ「Yeah, that's right.」
<00000356> black450
<00000357> v06si0348
<00000358> シルヴ「You're the princess. And the Sister, Belle, is the nameless angel.」
<00000359> ev017d
<00000360> v06si0349
<00000361> シルヴ「Since the two of you are partners, how about confirming your friendship?」
<00000362> v00an0814
<00000363> アンジ「W-why do we need to do that anyway?
<00000364> It's not like we're...」
<00000365> ev017e
<00000366> v06si0350
<00000367> シルヴ「...You're pretty slow.
<00000368>  What I meant was that you should give her this stone as a present.」
<00000369> ev017d
<00000370> After saying that, a smile appeared upon her lips.
<00000371> v00an0815
<00000372> アンジ「(―She meant that she wanted us to make up...?)」
<00000373> That's what I thought she was implying.
<00000374> black450
<00000375> And I quickly realized what that meant.
<00000376> ev017a
<00000377> v00an0816
<00000378> アンジ「(―Could it be?!)」
<00000379> That on the train ride to Chrome, she'd heard me and Belle arguing―,
<00000380>  no, this wasn't the right word to use, but I couldn't quite find the right one to describe what had happened between us.
<00000381> ...The reason was simple.
<00000382> Belle had used a Drop when she sang at the White Capital, which had worried me, and I'd questioned her about it.
<00000383> 
<00000384> 
<00000385> 
<00000386> But Belle didn't seem to know why I was asking her, so I got fed up―
<00000387> 
<00000388> v00an0817
<00000389> アンジ「(―And things got a little awkward...)」
<00000390> Silvia, who hardly could have known about all this, had seen right through me.
<00000391> As I thought that, I felt that I was hopeless at understanding others in comparison.
<00000392> v00an0818
<00000393> アンジ「...But, aren't Drops expensive?」
<00000394> 
<00000395> 
<00000396> I glanced at the gem I was holding, and closer inspectation made me realize that I couldn't afford it even if my purse were ten times as full.
<00000397> 
<00000398> ev017k
<00000399> v06si0351
<00000400> シルヴ「You can forget about the price. Take a look, there's quite a selection.」
<00000401> She smiled, and pointed to a gem in the opposite direction.
<00000402> v06si0352
<00000403> シルヴ「Your feelings are what's important, but there are times when you need material objects to show those feelings.」
<00000404> v06si0353
<00000405> シルヴ「See, there are times... like when you look at a present, and remember the precious feelings that person evoked in you, aren't there?」
<00000406> 
<00000407> Silvia was right.
<00000408> For Belle, maybe that Drop she used was just like a charm, a prized possession that helped her summon her courage.
<00000409> 
<00000410> 
<00000411> 
<00000412> Of course, even if the fact was that it had an effect like a drug, I still didn't have the right to tell her not to use it.
<00000413> 
<00000414> Instead, I should have been happy for her, since she was able to sing perfectly.
<00000415> 
<00000416> v00an0819
<00000417> アンジ「(―I should have been more open-minded...)」
<00000418> My own wishes were not necessarily what was best for her.
<00000419> If I didn't even try to understand her viewpoint, ignorance like that could sour the best of relationships. 
<00000420> 
<00000421> v00an0820
<00000422> アンジ「...Hey, Silvia.」
<00000423> I need to thank her for helping me realize...
<00000424> But I couldn't think of how to put it.
<00000425> And then,
<00000426> ev017b
<00000427> v00an0821
<00000428> アンジ「Do you have something that holds your precious feelings too?」
<00000429>  I asked, half jokingly.
<00000430> 
<00000431> black450
<00000432> v06si0354
<00000433> シルヴ「...W-well. I do have something like that.」
<00000434> v00an0822
<00000435> アンジ「(―Ah, that was unexpected...)」
<00000436> Silvia, dauntless as she is, is getting embarrassed?
<00000437> ev017j
<00000438> v06si0355
<00000439> シルヴ「But I've been too embarrassed to let that person know my feelings.」
<00000440> v00an0823
<00000441> アンジ「Hmm, I see.」
<00000442> v06si0356
<00000443> シルヴ「...Ugh, forget about my problems!
<00000444> Right now let's focus on your shopping!」
<00000445> 
<00000446> I'd finally noticed there was more to her than her egotism.
<00000447> ev017c
<00000448> v00an0824
<00000449> アンジ「So, which Drop is best?」
<00000450> 
<00000451> 
<00000452> v06si0357
<00000453> シルヴ「...Decide that yourself.」
<00000454> As if taking revenge for what happened earlier, she wouldn't give me her opinion.
<00000455> I checked the amount inside my purse, and finally decided on a gem.
<00000456> 
<00000457> ev017b
<00000458> v00an0825
<00000459> アンジ「...This, I guess?」
<00000460> v06si0358
<00000461> シルヴ「You've decided?
<00000462> Well, then I'll take over!」
<00000463> After saying that, she stopped me from trying to get the money from my purse.
<00000464> ev017d
<00000465> And then,
<00000466> v06si0359
<00000467> シルヴ「Hey, mister―」
<00000468>  She waved to the worker behind the counter, acting as if she'd changed into a completely different person.
<00000469> Speaking in a sultry voice completely different from her usual one, she started toying with the gem in her hands.
<00000470> v06si0360
<00000471> シルヴ「...Ehehe. Could you give me the usual discount, please?」
<00000472> black450
<00000473> v00an0826
<00000474> アンジ「(―That's pretty slick...)」
<00000475> Looking at her, I couldn't help but wonder if Tonino―
<00000476> ―might have had quite some trying experiences with her while we weren't around to see.

<00000012> セロ「Do you want to hurry back to the inn?」
<00000013> Cero, beside me, seemed to be picking up his pace as well. 
<00000014> I'd wanted to chat and take it easy while walking back, but at this moment, his suggestion was prudent.

<00000016> st03_c06
<00000017> v03wa1461
<00000018> ワカバ「...Then let's do that.」
<00000019> To catch up with his brisk pace, I tried to take longer steps.
<00000020>  ...But, is it the difference in our height? I even started to run―
<00000021> After noticing this, Cero naturally slowed down.

<00000024> ワカバ「(―Ah.)」

<00000026>  I was happy because Cero was so considerate of me.

<00000034> 
<00000035> All of them had been entirely my fault, but Cero had never scolded me for them.

<00000041> If I were to be scolded in front of everyone, it would leave quite a scar. But if it were just between the two of us―

<00000175> We'll meet up in Vermilion, the final stop before we return to Moosgrun- that was what me and Light decided.
<00000176> 
<00000177> When I was sharing this with them―

<00000204> That's totally correct. His accusation was like an arrow shot through my chest.

<00000389> Did she got mad just from thinking about it? She kicked a small stone under her foot into the road.

<00000422> ワカバ「Belle?
<00000423> Anne?」

<00000431> v01be0639
<00000432> ベル「...Do you want to go away from the inn for a while?」
<00000433> I opened the lip of the basket I was holding and pulled out a foldable umbrella.
<00000434> Even though it was small, if we stuck together we could still fit under it.
<00000435> st00_a00
<00000436> v00an0854

<00000454>

<00000466> アンジ「...After leaving the White Kingdom and heading to Chrome,
<00000467> 
<00000468>  I talked to you on the train about the time when you joined the choir team to sing, right?」 
<00000469> 
<00000470>

<00000475> 
<00000476> 
<00000477> 
<00000478> That alone was enough to understand why Angelina had been worried about the time I'd sung with the choir, back in the train.
<00000479> 
<00000480> When I had received maintenance in Aubergine, Father had given me a Drop. 
<00000481> 
<00000482> 
<00000483> 
<00000484> That Drop had the function of letting me disperse all idle thoughts and focusing on a single matter.
<00000485> 
<00000486> v00an0862
<00000487> アンジ「I heard from your father that the reason you felt ill before arriving in Aubergine was because you'd overdosed on anxiety-reducing Drops, right?」

<00000490> 
<00000491> 
<00000492> v01be0643

<00000495> 
<00000496> 
<00000497> v00an0863
<00000498> アンジ「―That's why I kept thinking things like ‘What if she falls ill again?’ or ‘She's done something dangerous’, and got really worried.」
<00000499> She took a deep breath as she concluded that.
<00000500> v01be0644
<00000501> ベル「(―So everyone knew about it...)」
<00000502> That I'd messed up by overdosing on Drops and caused everyone to worry.
<00000503> My cheeks burned in shame.
<00000504> ...But after thinking about it, that was a natural conclusion.
<00000505> Since Angelina was always with me, it would have been weird if Father hadn't told her about the reason I was feeling ill. 
<00000506> 
<00000507> sv025b
<00000508> v00an0864

<00000515> ベル「Miss... Angelina?」
<00000516> I was expecting Angelina to scold me after I admitted the truth. I didn't understand why she was apologizing. 
<00000517> 
<00000518> v00an0866
<00000519> アンジ「Just now, I was tempted to say something cool like ‘I was worried about you!’, but that wasn't what I was thinking at the time.」
<00000520> 
<00000521> v00an0867
<00000522> アンジ「―I was thinking of what it would be like to watch you sing without relying on the Drop.」
<00000523> 
<00000524> 
<00000525> v01be0647
<00000526> ベル「...I'm sorry.」
<00000527>  It was natural for her to say that.
<00000528> At that time, I surrendered to my temporary unease and gave up something much more important― 
<00000529> I failed to sing with everything I had and betrayed Angelina's trust in me. 
<00000530> That was something unforgivable, no matter how many times I apologize.
<00000531> But even so, Angelina―
<00000532> v00an0868
<00000533> アンジ「No, don't apologize. If you do, I'll feel bad.」
<00000534> She slowed her pace, and shook her head from side to side as she gazed downwards.
<00000535> v00an0869
<00000536> アンジ「...The fault was mine to begin with.」
<00000537> I couldn't understand her reasoning.
<00000538> v01be0648
<00000539> ベル「Why is that?」
<00000540> No matter how I thought of it, I was in the wrong, and not Angelina.
<00000541> v00an0870
<00000542> アンジ「At that time, I was the one who suggested you join the choir. It was thoughtless of me to suddenly tell you ‘Go ahead and sing.’」
<00000543> 
<00000544> v00an0871
<00000545> アンジ「―I didn't consider your feelings in the slightest, and was still excited to hear your singing even after you used the Drop.」

<00000558> v00an0873
<00000559> アンジ「I was the one who forced you to do it in the first place. For me to tell you ‘you mustn't use those Drops’... or something, how selfish of me.」
<00000560> 
<00000561> 
<00000562> It was obvious that she was trying to cover for me.
<00000563> v00an0874
<00000564> アンジ「...In addition, I even said that ‘I was worried about you...’ What's with me, I wonder?」
<00000565> Even as the rain grew quieter, Angelina's voice sounded as if it were about to disappear.
<00000566> v00an0875
<00000567> アンジ「―I was the one with the wrong idea.」
<00000568> I couldn't understand how could she keep disparaging herself.
<00000569> Even though I couldn't explain it, there was definitely something wrong with it.
<00000570> I wasn't good at disagreeing with people.
<00000571> But, right now―
<00000572> v01be0651
<00000573> ベル「That's not true at all. They're different matters entirely.」
<00000574> I said without thinking, and instantly regretted it,
<00000575> ...But since I've already disagreed with her, I can't take it back.
<00000576> v00an0876
<00000577> アンジ「Why?
<00000578> That's just your own conjencture...」

<00000581> I took a deep breath, and arranged the thoughts in my mind.
<00000582> v01be0653
<00000583> ベル「(―I have to calm down...)」
<00000584> That's because, right now, I need to clearly express my feelings to her.

<00000587> v01be0655

<00000591> v00an0877
<00000592> アンジ「―Earlier, when I said ‘since it's you I'm talking to, I couldn't explain everything...’ it might be because I knew that I was at fault.」

<00000596> v00an0878

<00000598> v01be0658
<00000599> ベル「That's not true!」
<00000600> v00an0879
<00000601> アンジ「...What about it isn't true?」
<00000602> I'd disagreed with her, but what I wanted to say was still locked inside my heart.
<00000603>  How can I translate it into words?
<00000604> v01be0659
<00000605> ベル「...Miss Angelina, why do you keep saying it was all just because of you?」
<00000606> v00an0880
<00000607> アンジ「It's just like I explained. If I'd been more mature, then I wouldn't have caused so much trouble for you...」
<00000608> v01be0660
<00000609> ベル「Please wait!」
<00000610> I shouted without thinking, shocking her.
<00000611>  Still, I had to say it.
<00000612> v01be0661
<00000613> ベル「...Please don't try to solve everything by yourself.」
<00000614> v01be0662
<00000615> ベル「If you just apologize and leave it at that, who knows when I might make the same mistake again in the future?」
<00000616> v01be0663
<00000617> ベル「―And that's why this is a problem for the both of us.」
<00000618> Finally, I'd made clear the reason I couldn't agree with how she kept blaming herself. 
<00000619> I hoped that she wouldn't end this matter by taking responsibility for it all.

<00000628> v00an0882
<00000629> アンジ「So, how about we recognize each others faults by saying ‘Sorry’ to each other?」
<00000630> Instead, she suggested that in a gentle tone.
<00000631> v01be0664
<00000632> ベル「......」
<00000633> As she stared at me, my mind went blank. I realized I'd nodded silently to her, and followed it up with ‘Wait!’

<00000647> I, Angelina, me again, Angelina again.
<00000648>  We bowed our heads and apologized to each other... four times each, just like that.
<00000649> Even though this must look strange to any passers-by, at the fifth time, we both bowed together at the same time―

<00000680> 
<00000681> As I realized that too, my expression seemed to make her smile.
<00000682> Even if it's a conversation of no importance, I felt that I and Angelina had grown closer.

<00000704> After a pause, she agreed.

<00000550> My plan had been to gather information on how Tonino and Silvia get along, then use it as a reference to help Sis.
<00000551> But, from what he'd said, it didn't seem like it would be much use.
<00000552>

<00000188> Not really that long ago, you know.
<00000189>  Just a couple of years. Ohohoho!」
<00000190> ―You're the one who said it.

<00000195> シルヴ「Eh?
<00000196> Ah, err. Well, it was just bugging me. There are times when you remember a name, but nothing about who it belonged to.」
<00000197> There are definitely times like that, but from the flow of this conversation... 
<00000198> (―Well, whatever...)
<00000199> (―She's being suspicious...)
<00000200> v03wa1521
<00000201> ワカバ「(―She's being suspicious...)」
<00000202> Judging from the concerned expression on Silvia's face when she'd mentioned Dua's name, it was not something so simple as trying to remember somebody.

<00000205> v06si0520
<00000206> シルヴ「...W-what's with that look of suspicion?」

<00000222> st06_a00
<00000223> v06si0523
<00000224> シルヴ「That's because Coco mentioned that name.」

<00000238> シルヴ「Alright, stop. I want to do that too, but that has to wait.」

<00000240> st06_a06
<00000241> v06si0526
<00000242> シルヴ「Since I've already started the tuning, if I ask her now, it might affect her,」

<00000253> v03wa1527
<00000254> ワカバ「―Hmm.」
<00000255> Did she mean Angelina? Or Belle?
<00000256>  Whoever it was, it wasn't me.
<00000257> v03wa1528
<00000258> ワカバ「(―Oh, well.)」
<00000259> I was just curious why Silvia had mentioned Dua's name.

<00000262> ワカバ「(―Ah, but speaking of Dua...)」

<00000266> st06_a05
<00000267> v06si0529
<00000268> シルヴ「...Hm?」
<00000269> Why didn't I notice this sooner!
<00000270>  Someone suitable to play the courageous female knight is right in front of me!
<00000271> 
<00000272> v03wa1531

<00000274> v03wa1532
<00000275> ワカバ「(―Well, whatever...)」
<00000276>  Thinking too hard is a pain.
<00000277> Even if Silvia is suddenly interested in Dua, the amazing hero, it has nothing to do with me.

<00000279> v03wa1533
<00000280> ワカバ「(―Nothing to do with me, but...)」
<00000281> I'd suddenly had a great idea.

<00000284> st06_a02
<00000285> v06si0530
<00000286> シルヴ「W-what?
<00000287> What's with that disgusting tone of voice?
<00000288> Are you sweet-talking the wrong person?」
<00000289>

<00000310> 
<00000311> Silvia laughed mischievously. 
<00000312> But then her expression suddenly returned to a serious one.
<00000313> st06_a00
<00000314> v06si0534
<00000315> シルヴ「...So, what is it?」

<00000317> v03wa1538
<00000318> ワカバ「Well, I was talking about Dua earlier. If you'd like, do you want to?」

<00000328> シルヴ「...Has anyone ever told you that you're bad at explaining things?」
<00000329> Silvia placed her hands on her waist and sighed heavily.
<00000330> Now that she mentions it, it was a failure when I tried to persuade Angelina as well.
<00000331> v03wa1540
<00000332> ワカバ「Then listen clearly, okay?
<00000333> I want you to play the role of Dua in our play. How about that?」

<00000335> st06_a03
<00000336> v06si0537

<00000339> v03wa1541
<00000340> ワカバ「It's okay!
<00000341> Dua is the female knight of the White Kingdom, she's the master swordsman that protects Princess Christina. Look, doesn't that suit you!」

<00000343> st06_a06
<00000344> v06si0538
<00000345> シルヴ「I'm confident in my shooting skills, but I've never used a sword before.」

<00001177> シルヴ「(―Ahh, what should I do...)」

<00001194> v06si0601
<00001195> シルヴ「So that means, your father is the... patron?」
<00001196> After Belle nodded slightly, Wakaba sighed a heavy sigh.

<00001207> She was so bold it was laughable.
<00001208>  ...But.
<00001209> Wakaba didn't laugh with me, or get angry.
<00001210>  She just kept on gazing straight ahead of her... at her future, no doubt.

<00001217> シルヴ「I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing. I understand your ambition.」
<00001218> In a way, she was shouldering a debt much heavier than ours.

<00001235> シルヴ「...Still, you've really surprised me. I never thought that you were...」
<00001236> Belle, who was sitting beside me, was actually Master Rein's daughter.

<00001240> v06si0609
<00001241> シルヴ「Well... I think I'm clear on everything now.」
<00001242> I understood that she was a Sister cared for by the doll engineer known as a national treasure, Master Rein, and confirmed that he was their patron.
<00001243> 
<00001244> Now that I knew that they had such an influential person backing them, I couldn't run away anymore even if I wanted to.
<00001245>

<00001251> Yahoo!」

<00001254> v06si0611
<00001255> シルヴ「Alright, alright. Don't make such a fuss.」

<00001259> シルヴ「(―Oh well, I'll just go sweet-talk Tonino...)」
<00001260> If he's willing to do it, he'll be much more helpful than me.
<00001261> I'm sure he wants to live up to the dreams he had in the past as well.

<00001282> シルヴ「C'mon, you two. We still have to talk about tomorrow, and there's someone waiting for me...」
<00001283> A chill ran down my spine.
<00001284>  I hadn't intended to forget about him, he had just completely vanished from my memory somehow.
<00001285> v06si0616
<00001286> シルヴ「(―Sorry, Tonino!)」
<00001287> It's not like he'll get angry.
<00001288>  He'll just crease his eyebrows a little and forgive me just like that.

<00001299> I don't have time to go back to my seat. I started running to where Tonino was.
<00001300>  If I can, I want to apologize to him without making any excuses.

<00001400> シルヴ「Wha!?

<00001440> When she starts to hesitate, it's usually because she made some kind of mistake and can't bring herself to admit it to me.
<00001441>

<00000008> Today we're practicing how to appear on stage.
<00000009> Basically, it's a dancing scene where the angel circles around Christina with playful steps.
<00000010> 
<00000011> It's very important for us to position ourselves in this scene, since if we move into the deeper parts of the stage as we enter, the audience will not be able to see us.

<00000023> v00an1490
<00000024> アンジ「...Yes, that's the rhythm.」
<00000025> From the right end of the stage to the left, we performed this dance a total of three times.
<00000026> It was a scene portraying the peacefulness of the White Kingdom at that moment.
<00000027> Belle was a quick learner and picked it up easily... on the other hand, I was getting left behind.

<00000036> Even though I'd complained, I knew that the problem was on my side.
<00000037> I was getting out of breath, and lacked the energy to keep up.
<00000038> I couldn't help but be shocked that my pace had been the one to slowdown when we did it this time.

<00000041> アンジ「(―Well, I can't deny that I don't get enough exercise...)」
<00000042> In addition, I had to wear a heavy dress in the real performance, if I keep this up... things would really get problematic.

<00000057> black450
<00000058> Me and Belle went to the side of the stage, and started the dance once more.
<00000059> When acting is concerned, if the pace is wrong, then everything becomes meaningless.
<00000060> It would be best to have managing the timing with a stopwatch, but right now there was nobody else here but us.
<00000061> 
<00000062> I had no choice but to rely on Belle's steady rhythm and continue the practice.

<00000071> If I can't even handle something like this, then how am I qualified to stand on the stage?
<00000072> I just need to dance in a single spot. Belle has a lot more work to do than I do.

<00000081> v00an1501
<00000082> アンジ「...Eh?」
<00000083>  Suddenly, something felt amiss. There was a slight difference in the spot where I was standing as we danced.
<00000084> 
<00000085> The reason I could realize that was because this was the ninth time we have done this, so my body naturally remembered the whole process.
<00000086> Even though I was familiar with the dance already, there was something different about this spot.
<00000087> v00an1502
<00000088> アンジ「(―I guess I'll fix it at the destination.)」
<00000089> Situations like this might occur during the real performance, so I have to adapt to the situation and change things accordingly.
<00000090>  I let Belle move to our destination before me.
<00000091>  But...
<00000092> v00an1503

<00000096> アンジ「(―She's standing in the wrong spot...)」
<00000097> Belle was dangerously close to the corner of the stage, and if she starts her dancing there... Oh no!

<00000135> v00an1510

<00000139> アンジ「Ouch!」
<00000140> A sharp pain invaded my right ankle, making me frown in pain.

<00000147> アンジ「It's fine, it's fine. This is nothing at all!」
<00000148> Though after balancing myself after standing up... the truth was clear.
<00000149> v00an1513
<00000150> アンジ「U-uh... Ugh...」
<00000151> The pain of putting my weight on my foot was enough to cause wrinkles on my forehead.

<00000013> Since if one thinks about it, as an accompaniment to a puppet play for children,
<00000014> the soothing tone of a reed organ is much more suitable than the plinking of a piano.

<00000941> With no other choice, the Cat Prince had secretly followed behind the Princess. The black cat Sister, Choco had joined too on the way, and there was a scene where the Cat Prince had wept.

<00000943> When they all started heading for the castle, Angelina played a marching tune while Belle sang along with the melody.

<00000235> We both fidgeted, staring outside the window and nodding to ourselves without any reason.

<00000244> We started to practice our lines quietly, so we didn't disturb anyone around us.
<00000245> Even though I still hadn't found out what Angelina would want, just by knowing that the feelings she held for me were still the same... I was very satisfied.
<00000246> 
<00000247> All that remains is to pray the present that I'll buy with our money will be something that she likes.

<00000016> When we first entered the library, we were left speechless by the vast amount of books.
<00000017> ev020q
<00000018> The number of books was far more than we had expected.
<00000019> Even I, who was used to the library in Moosgrun, took a deep breath in amazement.
<00000020> 
<00000021> It felt as if someone could wander among these bookshelves for days without seeing another person.

<00000028> Histories is nonfiction, but the play Wakaba is trying to create is fiction.
<00000029> 
<00000030> ev020k
<00000031> Moreover, in that play, Ein won't be an evil person... With that as a premise, the rest will take a lot of creativity.
<00000032> 
<00000033> Furthermore, no matter what we do, it will be hard to leave a good impression on the audience.
<00000034> 
<00000035> In the worst-case scenario, we might even have tomatoes thrown at us, like what happened in Aubergine.
<00000036> 
<00000037> But if I'm able to research as many documents as I can, and reflect them in the play, we can at least decrease the number of elements people will be skeptical of.
<00000038> 
<00000039> ...We have to make it as close to reality as possible.
<00000040> Even if nine people out of ten criticize this work, if there's at least one people who appreciates it... that would be nice.

<00000049> アンジ「That's not bad, I'd like to take a look if I had time.」
<00000050> Angelina's understanding of history was greater than I had expected. Previously, she had been quietly searching for books that seemed to be useful references.
<00000051> 
<00000052> ev020h
<00000053> Whereas Tonino... favored quantity over quality.
<00000054> 
<00000055> Still, having a strong man at times like these really does make you feel reassured.
<00000056> That's because it's likely that we'll have to deal with more and more books later on, thus more weight.

<00000075> トニー「I have no clue whatsoever what it's about...」
<00000076> ev020m
<00000077> Saying that, Tonino went to grab more books at his own discretion.
<00000078> 
<00000079> To the eyes of people who have no interest in them, all books look the same, I suppose?
<00000080> 
<00000081> And so, I sorted out the books that were of use from the pile that he brought me next, but―
<00000082> 
<00000083> v00an0748
<00000084> アンジ「Looks like it's pretty hard to find what we want.」
<00000085> v04ce1302
<00000086> セロ「Yeah, even if we get serious and pick up the pace, looking at our progress so far... it seems like it might take days.」

<00000090> v04ce1303
<00000091> セロ「I guess. You can say this is what I normally do, after all.」
<00000092> After we'd gathered a number of books, I sorted them into piles and started reading through them, prioritizing the books that couldn't be taken out of the library.
<00000093> 
<00000094> There were many such technical references that couldn't be borrowed. In addition, whenever someone wants to consult them, often they'll encounter other people who are still reading them.
<00000095> 
<00000096> 
<00000097> ev020o
<00000098> That's why, whenever I determine that the book in hand has information I was looking for, I quickly skim through it and copy it down.

<00000100> v04ce1304
<00000101> セロ「(―Hm?
<00000102> What book is this?)」
<00000103> Suddenly, I noticed a book that had been left beside my knee. I picked it up.
<00000104> The introduction claimed it to be a ‘dissenting’ view. Perhaps that makes it the same genre as the story Wakaba wants to write.
<00000105> 
<00000106> 
<00000107> ...But the contents of the book weren't really interesting, and from the first page it emphasized ‘this book is naught but falsehood.’
<00000108> 
<00000109> I placed it back on the shelf below me, and turned my concentration to the next book.
<00000110> v04ce1898
<00000111> セロ「...There's quite a lot of information regarding the White Kingdom...」
<00000112> ―At that moment.
<00000113> v04ce1899
<00000114> セロ「(―Huh, this is...)」
<00000115> The information about the clothing style during that period had caught my eye.
<00000116> v04ce1900
<00000117> セロ「...I guess I'll take a look at this...」
<00000118> Normally, when one thinks of history, it would concern famous people or events, but looking at these kinds of records is interesting too.

<00000122> アンジ「...Hey, could we take it a little easier looking for books?」
<00000123> v04ce1307
<00000124> セロ「Huh, why?」
<00000125> I was startled when Angelina appeared as if from nowhere and spoke to me.
<00000126> 
<00000127> ev020a
<00000128> v00an0751
<00000129> アンジ「That's because you've been reading the same book for a while, so the rest are piling up here.」
<00000130> 
<00000131> v04ce1308
<00000132> セロ「Ah, sorry, sorry!
<00000133> Please give me a minute.」
<00000134> ev020e
<00000135> This is embarrassing, it seems like I got too caught up in reading. 
<00000136> I quickly started sorting the books and tried to make some space for her to put down the books she'd just carried here.
<00000137> 
<00000138> v04ce1309
<00000139> セロ「...There, that should do it. Sorry, you guys can go back to your usual pace.」
<00000140> ev020f
<00000141> v00an0752
<00000142> アンジ「I got it, but this mountain of books...」
<00000143> She was right, I had just wanted to make some space quickly and pushed the books aside. It didn't solve the problem.
<00000144> 
<00000145> ev020j
<00000146> ...At that moment, Mr. Tonino came.
<00000147> v04ce1310
<00000148> セロ「Sorry, Mr. Tonino. I'm done with those books, could you help me by putting them back?」

<00000151> トニー「Right, leave it to me.」
<00000152> ev020m
<00000153> I bowed my head apologetically to him a number of times, then reached out to grab the next book so that the investigation could continue. 
<00000154> 
<00000155> ev020i
<00000156> I wonder how many days this research will take?
<00000157> Personally, I wouldn't mind even if it took a month―
<00000158> But I'm sure the two beside me would not allow me to do that.

<00000160> sr046a
<00000161> ev020i
<00000162> At that moment, I glanced towards the book that I had picked up earlier... and my hands stopped.
<00000163> That was the ‘dissenting view’ book I had skimmed through earlier.
<00000164> Srhn_BGM06
<00000165> As I picked it back up and flipped through the pages, a certain name caught my eye.
<00000166> 
<00000167> v04ce1902
<00000168> セロ「(―Hans Brant?)」
<00000169> Why did that name seem familiar?

<00000171> セロ「(―Now that I think about it, there was a Hans among the names that Coco mentioned.)」
<00000172> But there are many people who have the same names.
<00000173> Who knows jut how many people have had the name ‘Hans’ throughout all of history?
<00000174> 
<00000175> black450
<00000176> Still, the Hans that was recorded here... had been a courtly personage during the era of the White Kingdom.
<00000177> 
<00000178> v04ce1901
<00000179> セロ「...Hans Brant.」
<00000180> I repeated the name, and thought about it.
<00000181> v04ce1903
<00000182> セロ「Could it be...」
<00000183> Was this person the ‘Hans’ that Coco had mentioned?

<00000009> The place Belle had chosen for us to meet was a spot near the bridge where we had practiced our lines yesterday.
<00000010> 
<00000011> The ocean near the Blue Capital had filled the air with a salty smell, but the Red Capital's waters were rivers that flowed down from lakes.
<00000012> 
<00000013> Unlike the busy Blue Capital, where people would ship goods even through the city by its waterways, this place made it feel like time passed more slowly.

<00000020> It's just that as the thought of ‘did something happen to Belle?’ ran through my mind, a sudden sense of unease struck me.

<00000029> アンジ「...I wonder if she'll be okay.」
<00000030> If I had thought this might happen, I would have waited to meet up with her in front of the hotel, then went out together.

<00000036> アンジ「...Ah!」
<00000037> Across the avenue, Belle was running towards me, holding a bag in her arms.
<00000038> 
<00000039> I waved towards her, and she sped up.
<00000040> Her short skirt fluttered in the wind as she ran energetically.

<00000046> As I looked at her, panting for breath, all my complaints vanished without a trace.
<00000047>  Had she tripped from running too fast, I would have felt really bad.

<00000096> アンジ「Eh?
<00000097> ...What's this?」

<00000118> v01be1053
<00000119> ベル「...Yes.」
<00000120> After understanding what this bag she had gave me was, I calmed down slightly.

<00000146> Actually... I was really happy.
<00000147>  But despite that, I had no idea what to say.

<00000157> The faces of the members of our troupe floated one by one through my mind, and I thanked each of them within my heart.
<00000158> 
<00000159> Of course, I'll thank them face to face when I meet them later. Still, I wonder how Wakaba will react.

<00000288> It was true... she had appeared as the figure I had imagined inside my mind.

<00000038> トニー「That's not it!
<00000039> ...Damn.」

<00000045> v07to0181
<00000046> トニー「...Oi.」
<00000047> As her shoulder leaned against me, I was startled by the sensation of her soft body pressing against mine.
<00000048> 
<00000049> If she were one to behave as sweetly as this all the time... I wouldn't be complaining.
<00000050> 
<00000051> v07to0182
<00000052> トニー「...Hey, wouldn't you mind if anyone else were to see you like this?」
<00000053> st06_a08
<00000054> v06si0171
<00000055> シルヴ「Ah― maybe I'd be a little bothered if that happened, since it's embarrassing, right? Ahahaha!」
<00000056> She laughed happily, while slapping my back as if she were beating the dust out of a rug.
<00000057> v07to0183
<00000058> トニー「...Man, you're way too easygoing. Those guys might still be practicing even now, you know?」

<00000061> v06si0172
<00000062> シルヴ「......Ah.」
<00000063> It seemed like my words got through to her. Silvia's expression returned to normal, and she straightened up.
<00000064> 
<00000065> st06_a02
<00000066> v06si0173
<00000067> シルヴ「...Stupid Tonino. What a waste of the first time I've gotten a little tipsy in ages.」
<00000068> v07to0184
<00000069> トニー「Don't you think that ‘a little tipsy’ is an understatement?」
<00000070> st06_a03

<00000072> シルヴ「...Hmph...」
<00000073> It's not like I purposely meant to scold her...
<00000074> ...Still, when we headed back to the hotel with her still obviously drunk,

<00000078> シルヴ「Get another room,」
<00000079>  she suddenly said.
<00000080> v07to0185
<00000081> トニー「Silvia, acting all stubborn while you're drunk isn't cool at all, you know.」
<00000082> v06si0176
<00000083> シルヴ「I'm not drunk. I'm totally sober.」
<00000084> After saying that, she immediately asked:
<00000085> st06_a09
<00000086> v06si0177
<00000087> シルヴ「What's wrong―?
<00000088> Does a teetotaler like you really want to share a room with someone like me?」
<00000089> Seems like this won't go well.
<00000090> v07to0186
<00000091> トニー「...Do whatever you like.」
<00000092> There are still times where even I can't handle her.
<00000093> I can't afford to rent another room, so it seems like I'll have to leave and let her have our room to herself.

<00000098> v07to0187

<00000100> Considering the kind of guy he is, I'm sure he'll let me stay for a night.

<00000110> シルヴ「If I'd known this would've happened, I should have worn it from the start.」
<00000111> But if I did wear it... it was as if I'd promised Tonino to always stay by his side.
<00000112> 
<00000113> 
<00000114> It's not that I would mind that, but if I got tired of it, or if he had got tired of me―

<00000128> シルヴ「...I said, who?」
<00000129> I was reminded of how Coco and Light scared me in the past... there's nothing more frightening than someone creeping around without you having any idea who it is.

<00000139> シルヴ「Y-you!
<00000140> What do you think you're doing?」
<00000141> I was a little shocked when I caught a whiff of his breath.

<00000149> As I came to my senses, I realized that I had to hide the ring I was wearing on my finger, but I couldn't find anywhere.
<00000150> 
<00000151> With no other choice, I tried to hide my hand under a table, but―
<00000152> st07_a06
<00000153> v07to0190
<00000154> トニー「Hm?
<00000155> What are you hiding?」
<00000156> v06si0396
<00000157> シルヴ「I-it's nothing!」
<00000158> He rushed towards me, and grabbed my hand.
<00000159> Just like that, he discovered that I was wearing the ring.

<00000173> Words of gratitude had been the last thing I'd expected, and I replied stupidly.
<00000174> v06si0399
<00000175> シルヴ「Is that all? Don't you have anything else to say?」
<00000176>  I started complaining, completely forgetting my own situation.
<00000177> st07_a04
<00000178> v07to0193

<00000181> ...It's just as I'd predicted of him some time ago,
<00000182>  Tonino hadn't gotten angry... and instead forgiven me.

<00000196> Tonino, who was sitting on the floor, didn't reply to anything I had said.
<00000197> His blank expression was so amusing I just had to start teasing him.
<00000198> v06si0406
<00000199> シルヴ「Why do you always control yourself whenever we share the same bed? Are you trying to be a gentleman that isn't interested in women?」

<00000205> So you'll pass on that... is that what you're trying to say?
<00000206> But I'm not going to let you run away with that kind of excuse.
<00000207> That's because... I can't control myself anymore either.

<00000020> v03wa1959
<00000021> ワカバ「So, what did you find?」
<00000022> In these few days during which Cero had shut himself inside the library, I was in the hotel all the while, writing the script. 
<00000023> 
<00000024> Most of the script is finished, and there won't be any serious problems even if I have to revise something.
<00000025> 
<00000026> All that's left is to listen to Cero's report and change it accordingly... that's what I intend to do.
<00000027> The problem was that we had set as our goal a scenario that was ‘as close to the true history as possible’, but is that something we can achieve?

<00000171> セロ「Actually, I still have something that I hesitated to tell you about,」

<00000173> st04_a06
<00000174> v04ce1881
<00000175> セロ「―Do you remember what I said about finding ‘books that have evidence to prove a conspiracy?’」
<00000176> 
<00000177> v03wa1981
<00000178> ワカバ「Well, you told me not long ago, so of course I remember.」
<00000179> st04_a02
<00000180> v04ce1882
<00000181> セロ「Among those books, there was the diary of a certain person.」
<00000182> v04ce1883
<00000183> セロ「In that diary was recorded a detailed explanation and confession of a certain incident that happened in the White Kingdom.」
<00000184> 
<00000185> v03wa1982
<00000186> ワカバ「A detailed explanation... and confession?」
<00000187> st04_a07
<00000188> v04ce1884
<00000189> セロ「That diary was written by a person that had participated in a plan to cause Ein's downfall and regretted it, thus confessing his sins in a diary.」
<00000190> 
<00000191> v03wa1983
<00000192> ワカバ「So did he mention the conspiracy theory?」
<00000193> st04_a02
<00000194> v04ce1885
<00000195> セロ「Yes, the name of the person who wrote that diary was Hans Brant. He was a noble from the White Kingdom who had been sent as an ambassador to the Blue Kingdom.」
<00000196> 
<00000197> v03wa1984
<00000198> ワカバ「...Isn't that great!
<00000199> If that's true...」
<00000200> st04_a03
<00000201> v04ce1886
<00000202> セロ「...If that's true, huh. Of course, that diary as well claimed to be nothing but falsehood.」
<00000203> v03wa1985
<00000204> ワカバ「...You mean it's fake?」
<00000205> v04ce1887
<00000206> セロ「Yeah. Moreover, its contents were about the same as the other books that suggested a conspiracy.」
<00000207> 
<00000208> v03wa1986
<00000209> ワカバ「Well, then that's not enough.」
<00000210> st04_a06
<00000211> v04ce1888
<00000212> セロ「...Yeah. Were I still the me who had yet to set out on this journey from Moosgrun, I would have already given up.」
<00000213> 
<00000214> st04_a02
<00000215> v04ce1889
<00000216> セロ「―But, you know. We might be able to prove that the diary is genuine.」
<00000217> v03wa1987
<00000218> ワカバ「...How can we do that?」
<00000219> st04_a06
<00000220> v04ce1890
<00000221> セロ「Coco holds the answer.」
<00000222> v03wa1988
<00000223> ワカバ「...By Coco, you mean... Coco?」
<00000224> st04_a02
<00000225> v04ce1891
<00000226> セロ「Yes, Coco was the witness to that incident that happened in the White Kingdom. In addition, inside Hans' diary was written something that could be able to prove that.」
<00000227> 
<00000228> v03wa1989
<00000229> ワカバ「A-and what's that?」
<00000230> v04ce1892
<00000231> セロ「There was a single page in that diary that had the signature ‘CoCo’ on it. ...On the back of that page were entries the same as on the rest of the pages.」
<00000232> 
<00000233> v03wa1990
<00000234> ワカバ「...T-that's amazing!
<00000235> Isn't this something incredible?!」
<00000236> st04_a06
<00000237> v04ce1893
<00000238> セロ「If the material and age of the paper, the ink that was used, and the signature from that page match... history might have to be rewritten.」
<00000239> 
<00000240> v03wa1991
<00000241> ワカバ「S-so where is that diary?」
<00000242> st04_a08
<00000243> v04ce1894
<00000244> セロ「...Sorry, I asked the library officials to verify the original copy of the diary, so I don't have it at the moment.」
<00000245> 
<00000246> v03wa1992
<00000247> ワカバ「Ah, b-but that's okay!
<00000248> Now...」
<00000249> If that diary can be proven as genuine, then we might be able to prove that Ein is innocent!
<00000250> 
<00000251> This is a great discovery!!
